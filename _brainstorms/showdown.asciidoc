The year is 2099 and the world is even stranger than many would think possible.

In 2020 a computer virus emerged and became semi-sapient and caused many
computers connected to the internet to crash. This virus left messages on the
crashed computers, wherein it referred to itself as Digital Chaos. After a few
months of hard work, the virus was destroyed.

In 2033 FoxWing, a quite large company, entered into formal negotiations
with the state of Newark and the US federal government about becoming a
sovereign entity, seeking to have the same status as a state or territory.

In 2035 an artifact was discovered in a copper mine in the Gobi desert in
southern Mongolia. The artifact, now known as the "magic wand" was a 50
centimeter long rod made of a metal that resembled titanium, but it did not
have the same properties. It was handed over to a British university for study.
After a few weeks of of being studied, the artifact suddenly gave off a bright
light and a high dose of ionizing radiation. The radiation could be measured
instantly all around the globe. In fact, many people think the effect broke the
speed of light. Many nations went into high alert and the world held its breath
for long hours until it was clear that no nation had attacked another. Even
though the radiation could be measured all around the world, and many people
reported seeing strange lights in the sky, no people got sick. At least not
right away. Rather, it led to what is now known as <<Magical Emergence>>.  But
the calm did not last long. Only about 36 hours after the radiation event, the
Digital Chaos virus woke up, this time truly sapient, and still highly
malicious.

In 2037 it was discovered that computers and networks would not be infected by
Digital Chaos if they were 5 or more meters underground.

In 2038 it was discovered that computers that were hardened against radio waves
could resist DC infection, provided that they were not networked in any way and
had no radio receivers.

In 2038 a family of Dire Boar was found in a forest in Saxony, Germany. This
was the first discovery of meta-animals. Many more were to come in the coming
years.

In 2040 the FoxWing corporation was granted status as a sovereign territory in
the US in exchange for large cash amounts paid to both the state of Newark as
well as the federal government. FoxWing became known as the first Sovereign
Corporation, popularly known as a "Mega Corp" or "Power Corp". Many more of
these Mega Corps were to follow.

In 2040 the first airline opened using airships. They used one blimp for local
routes in the US, and a zeppelin to ferry people across the Atlantic ocean.
Air travel was extremely expensive since oil and gas were still at a premium.
Blimps and dirigibles could operate on partial electrical energy, which made 
them much cheaper.

In 2042 the Great European Racial Conflict took place. A large part of the
populous of Europe was scared of (and angry with) the new "mutant babies" and what they
represented. Almost 1 in 3 children under the age of 6 were now "mutated" in
some way. The problem was exacerbated since not many politicians had children
under the age of 6, and so could not directly relate to the problem. These
problems persisted for almost three years before the UN added articles to the
declaration of human rights to include sapient biological beings that could
trace their lineage back to 

In the 2050s the public and governmental trust in computers had increased to
the point that simple PDAs, tablets, and laptops gradually became legal and
popular, provided they were heavily shielded against radio waves of course.
Wrist computers would come a few years later because the technology to shield
such a small device against DC did not yet exist.

In 2059 the first Agent software framework was released.

== Magical Emergence

Many of the babies conceived after the day of magical emergence were more than
just human. Some had strange abilities we now know as magic, and some had
mutations that we know as classify as §§§RACES.

=== The Great Crash of '35

The magical emergence also revived the Digital Chaos virus and gave it powerful
magical abilities. It became able to infect and control any digital device with
a radio receiver or any computer that was not shielded against radio waves, and
infected computers could infect other computers if they were networked
together. And so the world quickly collapsed into chaos and mayhem as power
plants, airplanes, satellites, cars, ships, factories, farms and hospitals
failed catastrophically as their computer systems were infected with digital
chaos.  This demonic computer virus controlled the devices in such a way as to
cause as much mayhem, destruction and death as possible. Millions died almost
instantly, and millions more in the following days as the hospitals were no
longer able to function efficiently.

Here's a list of the most common things the world lost:

* Phones
* GPS
* WiFi
* Bluetooth
* Electronic payment
* Controllable drones
* Internet at home
* Digital TV and Smart TVs

==== But the world recovered

In the aftermath of the Great Crash, humanity started to very slowly rebuild
their infrastructure, using technology from the middle of the 20th century,
completely avoiding the use of computers.

It was discovered that computers and networks would not be infected if they
were located completely underground with at least 5 meters of rock or soil
above them.  This led to the construction of large underground facilities that
housed any vital services that required computing power.

Land line phones have also been replaced with technology from the 1960s where a
human switchboard operator will redirect your call.

There are, however, personal computers, wrist computers, self-driving cars, and
semi-autonomous drones. 


== The new World

=== New Humans

New human races.


=== Meta animals

Blah.


=== The Wild

Due to Druidic magic, forests and jungles have taken over much of the land.



=== Various

==== Minerals and fossil fuels

Fossil fuels are very expensive because extraction is difficult without
computers.  It does not help that the Druidic magic has made it much more
difficult to access mines.



=== Mega Corps

The first company to become a Sovereign Company (Mega Corp) was FoxWing, when
they exploited the US governments acute need for a cash infusion. In the US, a
Sovereign Company is effectively a state or territory. This means that the
employees who live on the corporate campus only pay federal tax, and that the
state does not need to provide any services (utilities, school, social
services, etc.) to those employees.

FoxWing also made a similar deal in Mexico in 2042. Many other companies
followed suit in the following years.  By 2060, more than 500 sovereign company
territories were registered all over the globe.

Not all of these territories function the same way. In some countries,
companies can be granted the same status as a foreign embassy, in others they
can be given status as small counties or municipalities.

The Philippines sold off a number of small islands to various companies,
completely surrendering them to those corporations such that they became
sovereign nations with their own passports, etc. These "Corponations" are not
UN members, nor do they have any formal army. However they do patrol their
borders with security personnel.

This led to MegaCorps having vast and widespread power, making it increasingly
difficult for independent startups to succeed.

However, many economists have noted that the selling of land to private companies
was the main driver in recovering the global economy after the Great Crash.


=== Agents

In 2059 the first Agent software framework was released. An Agent is a simple
"AI" that makes it much easier to use the device on which it runs. You can give
it verbal instructions and it can essentially make the device do stuff that
previously required a multitude of custom software.  For instance, you can ask
your agent to solve complex equations, or to set an alarm 10 minutes before the
next full moon rises.

But the most important feature of the agent framework is that the agent is
stored on a memory card that can be inserted into various agent-enabled
devices. This means that your agent can "live" in your PDA or wrist-comp on a
day-to-day basis, but you can move the agent to your car's computer when you're
driving.
