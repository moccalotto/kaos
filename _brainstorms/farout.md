## Premise
We are all AIs derived from humans and living in another solar system.

## Timeline

#### 2021, NuSol
A not-so-distant (about 60 light years away) solar system was found to have
at least two planets in the Goldilocks region. One was a super
earth (1.9g), and the other a bit less dense than earth (.8g).
Upon further investigation, researchers found a number of other planets
and moons in the system - most of which seemed to be rich in rare minerals and ores.
Since it was not feasible to travel that far, this info was marked as interesting,
and duly archived. The system was popularly called NuSol.

#### 2029, Fusion
The first generation of fusion reactors went online. At this point, 5th and 6th
generation fission plants were online, producing lots of power and only a little waste.
These plants had been built in order to satisfy the growing need for electrical power
caused by increase in battery powered transportation, heating, and industry.

#### 2030, Immersive Virtual Worlds
Brain-machine-interfaces had become good enough to allow fully locked-in patients
to experience life in a virtual reality world. A number of VR worlds were created;
the most important of these worlds were called Auther
(a contraction of "augmented" and "ether"), which simulated the real world to
some extent.  People in the real world would be able to interact with those
only present in the virtual part of the world via augment reality goggles,
their Smart Agents, or similar devices.

#### 2030, Space mining
Tentative space mining operations began with the aid of self-replicating factories
installed on the asteroids, and autonomous space engines, asteroids were mined,
and the ore transported to low earth orbit and then programmed to safely "land" in
or near oceans.

#### 2040, Improved Fusion
Second generation fusion reactors came online.
These could power ships and submarines.
One company even developed a fusion powered train.

#### 2041 Civil war
The USA experienced a brutal civil uprising and war.
Effectively, the Bible Belt became its own nation called The Sanctified States
of America (SSA). The SSA became a Theocratic police state with a large
military.  Former states that are now part of the SSA: Alabama, Louisiana,
Tennessee, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia,
South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia, and South
Dakota.
In order to avoid further conflict, the remaining states of the US chose the
name Allied States of North America.
This conflict lasted until 2045.

#### 2041 The ICA Drive
the Chinese Space Administration (CSA) in conjunction with a
number of Chinese and Indian universities developed a new space drive, called
the ICA drive. This drive was essentially a very powerful ion drive,
but it generated much more thrust with very little propellant consumption.
All it needed was a source of energy large enough - this could
best be achieved with fusion. Fission was also possible, but it required a
larger fuel payload.

#### 2042, Asteroid Mining with the ICA drive
CSA launched a number of ICA drive space ships to mine the outer
asteroid belts and set up manned space stations there. With the new drive,
supporting these operations would be cheap and ultimately profitable.

#### 2043, Self-replicating factories
CSA had begun serious space mining operations, with self-replecating ships and factories.

#### 2045, NuSol Telescope
CSA created a telescope in one of its factories in the Kuiper Belt and launched it into
interstellar space with the purpose of investigating the NuSol System.

#### 2041 Simulated Intelligence
The large number of fully immersed online games gave rise to a new product:
Simulated Intelligence. These were essentially AIs that could control your
online character while you were not logged in.
The SIs would be rented by players as part of a premium gaming package.
They would learn to act as the player would act by "observing" the players
actions and carefully monitoring the player via the brain-machine interface.
As so they would become able to almost perfectly mimic the player, even to
the point that it would be difficult for players to see which characters
were logged in and who were being controlled by SIs.
In 2041 the quality of these SIs had reached the point where a legal case in
the EU used character witness testimony from two different SIs that had
observed the same human playing two different games. The player had died
in a car crash, and there was a question legal about her will due to some
special circumstances her will did not account for. The two intelligences
agreed 100% on how she would want her estate distributed in the given situation,
and the court agreed with this decision.
This was the first step to using SIs in criminal cases and court rooms if
the actual human was not available. Some businesses even used certain SIs
to make post-mortem decisions on behalf of deceased CEOs.


#### 2051, information about NuSol
The NuSol telescope sent back proof that NuSol Gamma and Delta would
both be viable for sustaining life. Oceans of liquid water, and atmospheres
with reasonable (about 25-30%) amounts of oxygen. Humans could eventually be
cultured to thrive in those high-oxygen environments.

#### 2052 Probes to NuSol
North American (both SSA and ASNA), Indian and European space agencies sent
computer-controlled spaceships (probes) to NuSol. These missions were expected
to reach NuSol in about 300-400 years. Indian probes were self-replicating
for the purpose of gathering resources for later Indian missions to NuSol.

In 2060 the EU developed stasis technology that allowed the prolonging of life
by almost halting all bodily processes, including aging. Subjects could be in
stasis for up to a month, in which time they would age for a few days.  This
technology would later improve so that people could remain in the vault for up
to six months in which time the person would not age significantly. Stasis
vaults would slow down aging such that you would age about a month every two
years.

§§§§§§§ Merging SIs and wetware.

In 2072, CSA commenced the building of The CSA NuSol Ark Fleet. A number of
partially manned, highly automated spaceships, intended to reach NuSol in
about 500 years. The people on the Arkships would be stored in stasis vaults
and be genetically engineered to tolerate the extreme stasis cycles.
The motivation was two-fold: survival and greed. Earth was fast becomming
uninhabitable and drained of resources. And since the terraforming of mars was a
multi-century process, seeking fortunes in a new star system appeared to be the
way to go.

In the following 30 years, hundreds of "manned" and unmanned missions to NuSol
were launched. As time progressed, the ICA drive became more and more efficient
and powerful. This resulted in wide variety of NuSol missions: Some had the
purpose of over-taking the previous (and slower) spacecraft, and pave the way
on NuSol. Other missions were to rendezvous with the previous spacecraft and
resupply or improve them. It became a matter of pride and a matter of ownership
to be the first nation, agency or company to populate the new worlds and claim
its riches. Since communication delays were extreme, the majority of missions
were given very wide latitude and autonomy to achieve their goals. This
resulted in armed conflicts almost as soon as more than one agency landed on
the new worlds.

Most factions tried to guarantee the eventual success of their missions to NuSol
by sending a number of advanced artifical minds to the system.
These minds would activate if no human representatives were to arrive in a state
fit to act on behalf of the faction.
These minds were designed to emulate actual minds of specific members of the factions,
thus ensuring that the "spirit" of that faction would survive in NuSol.
Eventually, most of these minds were activated.

In 2077, a new global war broke out on earth. Initially, it started on the moon
when a rogue member of the Indian space agency used their mass drivers to
launch a large projectile onto the earth. The projectile, consisting mostly of
iron had devastating effects. It caused a Tunguska-style event in the middle of
Mongolia. This caused the Chinese to promptly attack India - both in space and
on earth. The space battles were quite crude, using communication lasers, mass
drivers and mining tools as weapons. The earth was on the brink of total
nuclear war. But it was preceded by the deployment of biological weapons on
massive scales.  More than one faction deployed deadly Ebola-style viruses.
More than one faction deployed kinetic strikes on enemy factions from space.

Viruses, meteor impacts and deployments of other strategic weapons of war has
resulted in an earth that is habitable, but far, far from ideal.

In the following years, many factions used all their non-war resources to
launch all possible ships towards the NuSol systems.  Ordinary ships were
converted into interstellar ships and launched. Many world leaders were on
these last ships.

Some efforts were also made to populate and fortify mars.

Securing the moon was considered a prime objective by all factions, and nuclear
weapons were heavily deployed there.

Thus, most spaceships were constructed or refitted on or near mining asteroids.

The humans that eventually reached NuSol were almost all exclusively
engineered; they could survive the long vault sleep without too much strain,
they would be able to tolerate the low gravity for the long sleep as well.

On NuSol there are several "breeds" of humans with different genetic traits.
The originals are fairly weak, but are extremely well adapted for brain machine
interfacing.  They can control spaceships and machinery with very well. They
can also tolerate space very well.  Such people are often very good pilots (but
they really suck on the ground).  There are the "colonizers" that have been
adapted for the individual planets they are on.  Most of them tolerate high
oxygen environment very well, and are very strong and capable when in such
environments - however, when they are on spaceships and other environs where
the oxygen source is reduced, so is their abilities.


## Factions


### The Sactified Brigade

After the first manned Chinese missions to NuSol, The Sanctified Brigade,
consisting mostly of military personnel from The Sanctified States of Ameerica,
launched an armada of Ark Ships to NuSol. This was in essence a Holy Crusade as
their primary mission was to carry out their »holy duty« to spread »morality
and decent living« throughout the universe. Being sponsored by almost a billion
people on earth, as well as having enormous lobbying powers in various
governments, especially the United States and Britain, The Brigade had extreme
funding to do their work. Many of the first exploratory missions to NuSol were
co-branded as religious missions.  Hundreds of the richest people on earth
joined the movement after being promised “eternal life among the stars”. Many
paramilitary groups joined as a sort of reciprocity to the enormous Chinese and
Indian NuSol efforts. After the movement gained vast momentum, and branded
itself as an organization of morality, rather than religion, members of many
other religions joined up, as they were promised to be allowed to practice
their faiths. In fact, the more strict the faith, the better.

Currently, The Brigade has a number of militia compounds, each comprised of
mainly of persons of the same sect of christianity. With a few exceptions, women
in these compounds are treated as property of their male husbands or relatives.
More than anything else, women are seen as a means of reproduction.

The Brigade has strong footholds throughout the NuSol system.

* Gothic
* Cult-like
* Bombastic
* Decadent
* Nazi Germany
* Empire á la Warhammer 40K.
* Navy Seals taken to eleven.


### The Swarm

The original Chinese explorers encountered the Swarm Lava.

They were quickly turned by it.

Humans infected by the Swarm Lava.

Inspiration: The Borg, “Vomit Zombies”, Humans controlled by the Star Flyer.

The swarm is what initially began using the WarpVerse

## Tech

### WarpVerse

The WarpVerse is "another univserse" that is loosely connected to our universe.
The WarpVerse is weird; it seems to not always adhere to the conventional laws
of physics. It seems to be mostly empty, consisting primarily of a special soup
of photons and extreme gravitational effects. There are pockets or "streams" in
the WarpVerse where these extreme forces are mild enough to allow specially
modified space ships to navigate. The layout of these streams resemble that of
a sponge or Swiss cheese.

The WarpVerse seems to be connected in such a way to our universe to
potentially allow instantaneous travel. However, travelling inside the
WarpVerse is in itself a time consuming task. Certain routes take longer than
others, and there is only a loose correlation between distance and travel time.

For instance, one 200 LY route may require 9 months of constant travel in the
WarpVerse, while some 20 LY may require as much as 8 months travel time.
Luckily for everybody involved, the travel time inside the WarpVerse matches
the perceived time outside the WarpVerse. In other words; the WarpVerse does
not allow time travel in any way.

Warp-enabled ships (also called WarpShips) need extreme shielding to survive
warp travel.  This shielding often consist of several meters of stone. The ship
must be completely shielded from all angles, forcing these warp ships to have
"warp modes", where they completely shield themselves from all sides, not even
allowing antennae or engines to protrude, and even fuse the shield plates
together with chemicals, enzymes and heat treatment.  Travelling in the warp
eats away at the shields at a rate of roughly one meter per month. Good pilots
can reduce this by constantly tweaking the position of the ship in the warp
stream.

### 3D Printers

You can print a decent smartphone (comlink) that works as soon as it comes out
of the printer.

You need factory-grade machines to produce current-generation microchips, but
chips that are one a few generations old can be printed on an up-to-date
prosumer grade printer.

### Augmented Reality

AR has become extremely popular; worlds where virtual avatars can interact with
the real world, and where people in the real world can interact with the
virtual avatars electronically.  Example: When walking around on a space
station or space ship, corridors and walk ways are used for many purposes;
cargo carts, personnel, engineering bots, and are even used as running lanes
from time to time. In order to minimize accidents and maximize the
utility,capacity and efficiency of these corridors, people use AR to see which
"lane" in the corridor they should stay in. These lanes are usually controlled
by an AI.


### Unsorted

Fancy word for smart phone.

Most spaceships can sustain an acceleration of .3Gs for a very long period of
time.

Having to deal with swarm creatures, certain factions of The Brigade has taken
to use genetic alteration.  They do not alter themselves; that is against their
fundamental codex. However nothing withholds them from experimenting on
animals, captured enemies, and even creatures that have been modified by a
third party already (and is thus already an abomination).

Many genetically modified creatures have entered the battlefield: Werewolves
(swarm angels infused with wolf or jackal genes.  Eagles, Wasps, Monkeys
(Berserker Gorilla) Hulks (humans infused with Gorilla genes) Minotaurs (guess
:-) )

It started with implanted tech to help victims of neurodegenerative diseases
have a better quality of life as their illness progressed.  At first it would
enable these immobilized humans get around and have agency in the world.  Later
it enabled fully locked-in patients to "live" in a complete virtual reality.
Later again, it enabled ALS-sufferers to use a so-called avatar; a human-shaped
drone that could act on behalf of the patient.

* Virtual vision (requires implant in eyes)
* Virtual hearing (requires implant in ears)
* Virtual scent (requires implant in nose/brain)
* Controlling of devices (cars, power suits, etc.)
    - Certain items register as new “limbs” using these limbs need a lot of
    training, but enables very quick responses.
    - Other items rely on a graphical interface in the Augmented Reality.
    Virtual hands can manipulate this UI.

*BrainPal*: You can have a computer in your brain. That computer can be strong
enough to power an AI that can assist you in many situations.

BrainPals are usually required for advanced operation of equipment, etc. As it
reduces the concentration needed by introducing abstraction.

The brain of an unconscious person can be accessed like a computer.

While you cannot access memories, you can feed the brain stimuli and measure
the reactions.

This means that you can do some basic communication with people who are
unconscious or in shallow comas.

Human brains can be upgraded with brain implants that give them skills.

The skills are only available when their use is prompted.

Knowledge skills are usually triggered by outside stimulus such as visual
events. (I.e. Knowledge about the layout of a specific underground bunker can
be triggered by entering said bunker or by seeing parts of the blueprints). The
host cannot stop this automatic triggering.

Active skills need to be prompted  by the host. I.e. If the host wants to
trigger the use of a fist-fighting skill, the host must think some key thoughts
about fist fighting.

Combined skills (such as piloting a ship or aircraft) can be triggered
automatically by sitting in the pilot’s chair, or by actively thinking of
piloting the craft.

Triggering usually takes about one combat round. The effects lasts about 5
minutes after the skill is no longer used.

The skills are “lost” when the brain implant is no longer assisting.

To assist the human brain, the implant requires a lot of power, and it is also
stressing the host brain by not letting it relax. It’s use should therefore be
kept to a minimum.

Adverse effects:
Stress,
Sleeplessness,
Paranioa,
Various personality disorders,
Robo-zombie (if used more that 8 hours per day, etc.)

Aerobic »plant« seems to mimic some of the properties of coral. It can be used
to create the walls of buildings. While growing, it will need constant
»feeding« (usually by spraying calcium carbonate or similar nutrients on the
surface or the coral).

A Stasis vault is a machine that vastly reduces the speed of biological processes.

People in stasis experience nothing but a dreamless sleep.

A stasis vault is quite large. It takes up nearly 6 cubic meters. There are many reasons for this:

1. The body has to be submerged in a special liquid.
2. The liquid has to be continuously pumped, sterilized and temperature controlled.
3. There is machinery in place to ensure that the body does not get pressure sores or similar.
4. There is a lot of redundant machinery and circuitry to ensure uninterrupted operation.

Stasis vaults weigh between 4000-10000 kg, depending on their quality and
design. Light-weight models are usually very expensive (or not safe for
sustained use).

Currently, people can stay in stasis for up to 6 months. During this period,
they only age about a week.  After 6 months, the person must be awakened and
undergo about a weeks worth of intensive physical therapy before they can be
safely put into stasis again.

Thus, when using stasis to maximal capacity, humans will age about a month
every two years.

People just waking up from stasis are very week. They must undergo at least a
weeks worth of intense physical therapy to reach their former physical
capabilities.

DNA is repaired via a retrovirus. Patient is kept in a medical coma for about
60 days. After that  comes 5-6 months of rehabilitation, consisting of hard
physical exercise, physiotherapy, a very strict diet and constant monitoring.
The treatment costs about two years of middle income salary.  The treatment
makes the human appear young. Many of the ailments that come with age disappear
- however, worn teeth and bones are not repaired (though this can be done via
other treatments).  The treatment ensures that the human does not age further
for 20 to 30 year

Offers a suite of functions for prolonging high-quality life; Nanites combat
mutation and symptoms of illnesses, broken bones, etc.

Machine Assisted Living also helps with keeping cognitive functions running at
peak performance. It can also help with memory and skill retention - even
active skills.  Memory retention is only facts though - not real reconstruction
of past events.

MAL can also improve physical strength and dexterity.

Implanted computers can record a persons thought processes, hormone levels,
sensory inputs, etc.

From this information, a persons personality can be inferred and synthesized.

The more advanced the recorder, and the longer it stays in place, the more
accurate the personality.

During the recording sessions, the person must be aware that they are creating
a virtual personality. They mut undergo a lot of mental training and
"calibration". If they do not do this, the VP will go insane when it boots up.
The training involves simulations of being a virtual personality. I.e. Living
without a body. Etc.

Bad quality VPs tend to degenerate (i.e. Diverge from the original personality)
after a few months. However, they can be reset.

High quality VPs can potentially function for centuries. They can learn and
adapt. They will, of course diverge slightly from the original personality, as
they gain their own experiences.

Human body with a computer instead of a brain.

Nervous system is replaced with artificial nerves.

The computer runs Virtual Personality.

Robot body with VP brain.

Nanotech.

Nanites, combined with special “building molecules” can construct many things.

They can also do repair jobs.

Self-repairing armor.

Stuff may penetrate it, but it will regenerate afterwards.

It may need energy or molecule supplements after some time.

Nano-DNA is the ROM of a nanite. It determines what that nanite can do and
become.

nDNA can be thought of as the programming of the nanites.

nDNA can contain a wealth of info, but is still fairly limited.

Sometimes, nDNA is split such that hundreds or thousands of nanites need to
work together to form the complete memory. This is tricky but useful.


Nanites can make up a building structure.

The nDNA determines how the final building looks.

Once the building is finished, the nanites can no longer function.

While the nanites are working, they must receive regular energy boosts via
special radiation.

Nanites can regenerate and/or replace human cells.

The efficacy of nano-healing depends on the type of injury, the nDNA of the
nanites, and the amount of available power and building materials.

The effects are very similar to “regeneration”

Many cancers can also be cured or kept in check with nanites.

Adverse effects: Over-regeneration: mutation (if the nanites have an error in
their nDNA) Cancer (that cannot be cured with nanites because it would cause
even more nanite overdose effects) Robo-zombie

Bullets that push active nanites into the target. These nanites target vital
organs, etc.

Bullet efficiency depends on the nDNA of the nanites.

See Slap Patch.

Mag that creates the bullets on an ad-hoc basis, using nannies.

The mag receives the specs of the bullet from the host gun, and instantly
creates the bullet.

Creating bullets can take as little as 10 milliseconds

Certain bullets take longer.

Guns can be programmed so that alternating bullet properties are created.
Example: every third bullet must be a tracer or every second bullet must be an
APFSDS (armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot)  bullet.

A 5x5cm rubbery plate with a plastic coating on both sides.

The patch is activated by removing the plastic coating from one side.

It is then applied (slapped) to the bare skin of the subject. Then the effects
begin.

There are many types of slap patch:

Healing: introduce regenerating nanites into the affected area.

Booster: introduce material-carrying nanites into the affected area. The
nanites provide raw matter that boosts the efficiency of the nanites already in
the subjects body.

Damage: Introduce degenerating nanites into the affected area. These cause
damage over time. They can even replicate to multiply the damage.

Stun: The nanites will anesthetize the affected area. If the area is the neck,
chest (over the heart) or head, the subject will fall unconscious.

Black plates/Panels that, via electromagnetism, can control the shape and phase
of a special nano-carbon powder. They can create diamond hard surfaces.  When
the armor cells are reformatting the armor surface, a high electronic buzzing
can sometimes be heard.  Armor panels can operate in three distinct modes

* Power preservation: the nano-carbon powder is kept in place via
electromagnetism. The powder appears to lie evenly spread out on the surface of
the panel, but in reality, it held just a few micrometers above the surface.
* Shaping: the nano-powder is “squashed” via electromagnetism until it turns
into a pseudo-liquid phase. The liquid will almost instantly appear to be solid
because it is kept in place by very strong magnetic forces.
* Crystal: the carbon nano-powder is squashed even more and turns into one of a
number of pseudo solid crystal phases. The properties of these crystal phases
can be “selected” when formatting the state. Hardness, low electrical
conductivity and low thermal conductivity are the three primary properties to
select between. A combat armor will usually be formatted for hardness as its
primary attribute, with electrical protection as a secondary property. Most
combat armors will try to format for a relatively high thermal conductivity to
avoid over-heating the wearer.

Awesome power storage.

Batteries that can contain much more power than today.

Possibly á la Niling D-Sinks.

Gray armor that resembles elephant skin. It covers a person in its entirety,
making that person to appear extremely large.  This extremely tough skin is
powered by organic muscles, which are “fed” by a blood-connection with the
human host.  The suit itself carries around 3 liters of blood. When not worn,
the blood is infused with nutrients and oxygen via simple medical machinery.
When wearing skin suit, the host needs to be on a strict, but very caloric
diet. The host may also need extra oxygen in his/her air to support high-stress
and high-strain situations. Some suits have gills to assist with oxygenation,
but these types of suits are more open to chemical attacks.

The special “lava” that can somehow interact with complex molecules such as proteins.

Inspiration: the “goo” that creates vomit zombies.

Swarm Agents (also called Swarm Angels).

* Think Liloo from Fifth Element.
* Also think of the humans infected by the Star Flyer from The Commonwealth
ofSeries.
* Beautiful, hard to kill, intelligent, independent, agents of The Swarm. They
have special, hardcore DNA á la Fifth Element.
* Agents have no feelings other than complete loyalty to The Swarm, but they
are excellent at faking feelings.
* These agents have special DNA, but do not contain any swarm lava molecules.
* They are not in direct communication with The Swarm.
* They are able to act completely independently.
* They are based on real humans:
    - They can be created by reanimating a dead human, thus leaving the Angel
    without any memories (because of the brain death).
    - They can be created by brainwashing (and genetically modifying) a living
    human - leaving the human with all original memories.


Swarm Monster.  Inspiration: Vomit Zombie.

Breeder Reactors. (Reactors that generate new fissionable materials).

One of these: Liquid fluoride thorium reactor.

Fusion power and fusion propellant.

Large spaceships must be built in space.

Materials for ship hulls, etc. Mostly comes from asteroids, moons and other
space-mining ventures.

Some spaceships are built out of hollowed-out asteroids. These are sometime
called stoneskin ships.

Some ships have an asteroid core with "platforms" built on the surface. These
are sometimes called stonecore ships. Stonecore ships often do mining
operations while in space. Waste material can be used as propellant.  Some
ships even use multiple small asterioids and comets to provide more material,
fuel (helium-3 and other gasses), air and water.


Most cargo ships are often build like  |---|> the middle section has room for
tens, hundreds or even thousands of containers.  Some containers have the
ability to survive atmosphere entry as a kind of drop-pods.

MAD: Moon, Asteroid, Dwarf Planet.

MADs have low gravity, allowing large spaceships to land.

A little gravity is better than no gravity when it comes to humans.

They are quite large: allowing room for construction of large habitats.

MADs sometimes have usable resources (potable water, helium, hydrogen, etc.).

MADs rarely have dense atmospheres, simplifying space flight.

MADs sometimes have magnetospheres, protecting inhabitants from solar radiation, etc.

Adrenaline implants that make you go all-powerful of doom for a brief period of time.

After that you are totally wasted.

The more powerful the booster, the more wasted you are afterwards.

Also available: permanent physical improvements and modifications.

Fancy exo skeletons that help manual workers do their thing.

"Walker" suits for Originals.

Cyborg-suits with prosthetic limbs.
