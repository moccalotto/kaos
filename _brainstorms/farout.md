## Timeline
In the year 2021, a not-so-distant (about 35 light years away) solar system was found to have at least two planets in the goldilocks region.
One was a super earth (1.9g) , and the a bit less dense than earth (.8g).
Upon further investigation, researchers found a number of other planets and moons in the system - most of which seemed to be rich in rare minerals and ores.
Since it was not feasible to travel 30 ly, this info was marked as interesting, and duly archived.  The system was popularly called NuSol.

In 2029, generation 1 fusion reactors went online.
At this point, 5th and 6th generation fission breeder and LIFTR plants were online, producing lots of power and only a little waste.
These plants had been built in order to satisfy the growing need for electrical power, caused by increase in battery powered transportation.

In 2031, serious space mining operations had begun.
With the aid of self-replicating factories installed on the asteroids, and autonomous space engines, asteroids were mined,
and the ore transported to low earth orbit and then programmed to safely "land" in or near oceans.

In 2036, brain-machine-interfaces had become good enough to allow fully locked-in patients to experience life in a virtual reality world.
A number of VR worlds were created; the most important of these worlds were called Auther (a contraction of "augmented" and "ether"),
which simulated the real world to some extent.
People in the real world would be able to interact with those only present in the virtual part of the world via augment reality goggles,
their Smart Agents, or similar devices.

In 2038, generation 2 fusion reactors went online. These could power ships and even airplanes.

In the year 2041, the Chinese Space Administration (CSA), in conjunction with a number of Chinese and Indian universities developed a new space drive,
called the ICA drive. This drive created extreme thrust with very little propellant consumption.
All it needed was a source of energy large enough - this could best be achieved with fusion. Fission was also possible,
but it required a larger fuel payload.

In 2042, CSA launched a number of ICA drive space ships to mine the outer asteroid belts and set up manned space stations out there.
With the new drive, supporting these operations would be cheap and ultimately profitable.

In 2045, CSA launched a space telescope into interstellar space.
Its main purpose was to investigate the NoSul system.

In 2051, the NuSol telescope sent back proof that NuSol Gamma and Delta would both be viable for sustaining life.
Oceans of liquid water, and atmospheres with reasonable (about 25-30%) amounts of oxygen.
Humans could eventually be cultured to thrive in those high-oxygen environments.

In 2052 North American, Indian and European space agencies sent computer-controlled spaceships to NuSol.
These missions were expected to reach NuSol in about 300 years time.

In 2072, CSA commenced the building of The CSA NuSol Arkship.
A manned spaceship, intended to reach NuSol in about 250 years.
The crew and personnel on the Arkship would be stored in stasis vaults,
and be genetically engineered to tolerate the extremely long sleep in the vaults.
The motivation was simple: to survive. Earth was becoming more and more uninhabitable,
and the terraforming of mars was a multi-century process.
Thus, seeking fortunes on new planets appeared to be the way to go.

In the following 30 years, hundreds of manned and unmanned missions to NuSol were launched.
As time progressed, the ICA drive became more and more efficient and powerful.
This resulted in wide variety of NuSol missions: Some had the purpose of over-taking the previous (and slower) spacecraft,
and pave the way on NuSol.
Other missions were to rendezvous with the previous spacecraft and resupply or improve them.
It became a matter of pride and a matter of ownership to be the first nation, agency or company to populate the new worlds and claim its riches.
Since communication delays were extreme, the majority of missions were given very wide latitude and autonomy to achieve their goals.
This resulted in armed conflicts almost as soon as more than one agency landed on the new worlds.

In 2077, a new global war broke out on earth. Initially, it started on the moon when a rogue member of the Indian space agency
used their mass drivers to launch a large projectile onto the earth.
The projectile, consisting mostly of iron had devastating effects. It caused a Tunguska-style event in the middle of Mongolia (MAYBE).
This caused the Chinese to promptly attack India - both in space and on earth. The space battles were quite crude, using communication lasers,
mass drivers and mining tools as weapons.
The earth was on the brink of total nuclear war. But it was preceded by the deployment of biological weapons on massive scales.
More than one faction deployed deadly ebola-style viruses. More than one faction dropped heavy stuff down the gravity well.

Viruses, meteor impacts and deployments of other strategic weapons of war has resultet in an earth that is habitable, but far, far from ideal.

In the following years, many factions used all their non-war resources to launch all possible ships towards the NuSol systems.
Ordinary ships were converted into interstellar ships and launched. Many world leaders were on these last ships.

Some efforts were also made to populate and fortify mars.

Securing the moon was considered a prime objective by all factions, and nuclear weapons were heavily deployed there.

Thus, most spaceships were constructed or refitted on or near mining asteroids.

The humans that eventually reached NuSol were almost all exclusively engineered;
they could survive the long vault sleep without too much strain, they would be able to tolerate the low gravity for the long sleep as well.

On NuSol there are several "breeds" of humans with different genetic traits.
The originals are fairly weak, but are extremely well adapted for brain machine interfacing.
They can control spaceships and machinery with very well. They can also tolerate space very well.
Such people are often very good pilots (but they really suck on the ground).
There are the "colonizers" that have been adapted for the individual planets they are on.
Most of them tolerate high oxygen environment very well, and are very strong and capable when in such environments - however, when they are on spaceships and other environs where the oxygen source is reduced, so is their abilities.


## Factions


### The Sactified Brigade

After the first manned Chinese missions to NewSol, The Sanctified Brigade, a paramilitaristic religious organization was formed as a result of an alliance between the mormon church, the roman catholic church, the British royal family and the scientologists.
Their primary mission was to carry our their »holy duty« to spread »morality and decent living« throughout the universe. Being sponsored by almost a billion people on earth, as well as having enormous lobbying powers in various governments, especially the United States and Brittain, The Brigade had extreme funding to do their work. Many of the first exploratory missions to NewSol were co-branded as religious missions.
Hundreds of the richest people on earth joined the movement after being promised “eternal life among the stars”.
Many paramilitary groups joined as a sort of reciprocity to the enormous Chinese NewSol efforts.
After the movement gained vast momentum, and branded itself as an organization of morality, rather than religion, members of many other religions joined up, as they were promised to be allowed to practice their faiths. In fact, the more strict the faith, the better.

After the co-sponsoring of several scientific missions, The Brigade built their own armada of ark ships. These ships were the manifestation of a holy crusade to the new worlds. The crusade had the primary purpose of securing places for its member factions. Each member faction had a flag ship in the armada.

Currently, The Brigade has a number of militia compounds, each comprised of mainly of persons of the same faith. With a few exceptions, women in these compounds are treated as property of their male husbands or relatives. More than anything else, women are seen as a means of reproduction.

The Brigade has strong footholes throughout the NewSol system.

* Gothic
* Cult-like
* Bombastic
* Decadent
* Nazi Germany
* Empire á la Warhammer 40K.
* Navy Seals taken to eleven.


### The Swarm

The original Chinese explorers encountered the Swarm Lava.

They were quickly turned by it.

Humans infected by the Swarm Lava.

Inspiration:
The Borg
“Vomit Zombies”
Humans controlled by the Star Flyer.



## Tech


You can print a decent smartphone (comlink) that works as soon as it comes out of the printer.

You need factory-grade machines to produce current-generation microchips, but chips that are one a few generations old can be printed on an up-to-date prosumer grade printer.

AR has become extremely popular; worlds where virtual avatars can interact with the real world, and where people in the real world can interact with the virtual avatars electronically.

Fancy word for smart phone.

Smart agents can be controlled via voice, via motions and via BMI.

Most spaceships can sustain an acceleration of .3Gs for a very long period of time.

Having to deal with swarm creatures, certain factions of The Brigade has taken to use genetic alteration.
They do not alter themselves; that is against their fundamental codex. However nothing withholds them from experimenting on animals, captured enemies, and even creatures that have been modified by a third party already (and is thus already an abomination).

Many genetically modified creatures have entered the battlefield:
Werewolves (swarm angels infused with wolf or jackal genes.
Eagles,
Wasps,
Monkeys (Berserker Gorilla)
Hulks (humans infused with Gorilla genes)
Minotaurs (guess :-) )

It started with implanted tech to help victims of neurodegenerative diseases have a better quality of life as their illness progressed.
At first it would enable these immobilized humans get around and have agency in the world.
Later it enabled fully locked-in patients to "live" in a complete virtual reality.
Later again, it enabled ALS-sufferers to use a so-called avatar; a human-shaped drone that could act on behalf of the patient.

Virtual vision (requires implant in eyes)
Virtual hearing (requires implant in ears)
Virtual scent (requires implant in nose/brain)
Controlling of devices (cars, power suits, etc.)
	Certain items register as new “limbs” using these limbs need a lot of training, but enables very quick responses.
	Other items rely on a graphical interface in the Augmented Reality. Virtual hands can manipulate this UI.

BrainPal: You can have a computer in your brain. That computer can be strong enough to power an AI that can assist you in many situations.

BrainPals are usually required for advanced operation of equipment, etc. As it reduces the concentration needed by introducing abstraction.

The brain of an unconscious person can be accessed like a computer.

While you cannot access memories, you can feed the brain stimuli and measure the reactions.

This means that you can do some basic communication with people who are unconscious or in shallow comas.

Human brains can be upgraded with brain implants that give them skills.

The skills are only available when their use is prompted.

Knowledge skills are usually triggered by outside stimulus such as visual events. (I.e. Knowledge about the layout of a specific underground bunker can be triggered by entering said bunker or by seeing parts of the blueprints). The host cannot stop this automatic triggering.

Active skills need to be prompted  by the host. I.e. If the host wants to trigger the use of a fist-fighting skill, the host must think some key thoughts about fist fighting.

Combined skills (such as piloting a ship or aircraft) can be triggered automatically by sitting in the pilot’s chair, or by actively thinking of piloting the craft.

Triggering usually takes about one combat round. The effects lasts about 5 minutes after the skill is no longer used.

The skills are “lost” when the brain implant is no longer assisting.

To assist the human brain, the implant requires a lot of power, and it is also stressing the host brain by not letting it relax. It’s use should therefore be kept to a minimum.

Adverse effects:
Stress,
Sleeplessness,
Paranioa,
Various personality disorders,
Robo-zombie (if used more that 8 hours per day, etc.)

Aerobic »plant« seems to mimic some of the properties of coral. It can be used to create the walls of buildings. While growing, it will need constant »feeding« (usually by spraying calcium carbonate or similar nutrients on the surface or the coral).

A stasis vault is a machine that vastly reduces the speed of biological processes.

People in stasis experience nothing but a dreamless sleep.

A stasis vault is quite large. It takes up nearly 6 cubic meters. There are many reasons for this:
1. The body has to be submerged in a special liquid.
2. The liquid has to be continuously pumped, sterilized and temperature controlled.
3. There is machinery in place to ensure that the body does not get pressure sores or similar.
4. There is a lot of redundant machinery and circuitry to ensure uninterrupted operation.

Stasis vaults weigh between 4000-10000 kg, depending on their quality and design. Light-weight models are usually very expensive (or not safe for sustained use).

Currently, people can stay in stasis for up to 6 months. During this period, they only age about a week.
After 6 months, the person must be awakened and undergo about a weeks worth of intensive physical therapy before they can be safely put into stasis again.

Thus, when using stasis to maximal capacity, humans will age about a month every two years.

People just waking up from stasis are very week. They must undergo at least a weeks worth of intense physical therapy to reach their former physical capabilities.

DNA is repaired via a retrovirus. Patient is kept in a medical coma for about 60 days. After that  comes 5-6 months of rehabilitation, consisting of hard physical exercise, physiotherapy, a very strict diet and constant monitoring.
The treatment costs about two years of middle income salary.
The treatment makes the human appear young. Many of the ailments that come with age disappear - however, worn teeth and bones are not repaired (though this can be done via other treatments).
The treatment ensures that the human does not age further for 20 to 30 year



Offers a suite of functions for prolonging high-quality life; Nanites combat mutation and symptoms of illnesses, broken bones, etc.

Machine Assisted Living also helps with keeping cognitive functions running at peak performance. It can also help with memory and skill retention - even active skills.  Memory retention is only facts though - not real reconstruction of past events.

MAL can also improve physical strength and dexterity.

Implanted computers can record a persons thought processes, hormone levels, sensory inputs, etc.

From this information, a persons personality can be inferred and synthesized.

The more advanced the recorder, and the longer it stays in place, the more accurate the personality.

During the recording sessions, the person must be aware that they are creating a virtual personality. They mut undergo a lot of mental training and "calibration". If they do not do this, the VP will go insane when it boots up. The training involves simulations of being a virtual personality. I.e. Living without a body. Etc.

Bad quality VPs tend to degenerate (i.e. Diverge from the original personality) after a few months. However, they can be reset.

High quality VPs can potentially function for centuries. They can learn and adapt. They will, of course diverge slightly from the original personality, as they gain their own experiences.

Human body with a computer instead of a brain.

Nervous system is replaced with artificial nerves.

The computer runs Virtual Personality.

Robot body with VP brain.

Nanotech.

Nanites, combined with special “building molecules” can construct many things.

They can also do repair jobs.



Self-repairing armor.

Stuff may penetrate it, but it will regenerate afterwards.

It may need energy or molecule supplements after some time.

Nano-DNA is the ROM of a nanite. It determines what that nanite can do and become.

nDNA can be thought of as the programming of the nanites.

nDNA can contain a wealth of info, but is still fairly limited.

Sometimes, nDNA is split such that hundreds or thousands of nanites need to work together to form the complete memory. This is tricky but useful.


Nanites can make up a building structure.

The nDNA determines how the final building looks.

Once the building is finished, the nanites can no longer function.

While the nanites are working, they must receive regular energy boosts via special radiation.

Nanites can regenerate and/or replace human cells.

The efficacy of nano-healing depends on the type of injury, the nDNA of the nanites, and the amount of available power and building materials.

The effects are very similar to “regeneration”

Many cancers can also be cured or kept in check with nanites.

Adverse effects:
Over-regeneration: mutation (if the nanites have an error in their nDNA)
Cancer (that cannot be cured with nanites because it would cause even more nanite overdose effects)
Robo-zombie

Bullets that push active nanites into the target. These nanites target vital organs, etc.

Bullet efficiency depends on the nDNA of the nanites.

See Slap Patch.

Mag that creates the bullets on an ad-hoc basis, using nannies.

The mag receives the specs of the bullet from the host gun, and instantly creates the bullet.

Creating bullets can take as little as 10 milliseconds

Certain bullets take longer.

Guns can be programmed so that alternating bullet properties are created. Example: every third bullet must be a tracer or every second bullet must be an APFSDS (armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot)  bullet.



A 5x5cm rubbery plate with a plastic coating on both sides.

The patch is activated by removing the plastic coating from one side.

It is then applied (slapped) to the bare skin of the subject. Then the effects begin.

There are many types of slap patch:

Healing: introduce regenerating nanites into the affected area.

Booster: introduce material-carrying nanites into the affected area. The nanites provide raw matter that boosts the efficiency of the nanites already in the subjects body.

Damage: Introduce degenerating nanites into the affected area. These cause damage over time. They can even replicate to multiply the damage.

Stun: The nanites will anesthetize the affected area. If the area is the neck, chest (over the heart) or head, the subject will fall unconscious.

Black plates/Panels that, via electromagnetism, can control the shape and phase of a special nano-carbon powder. They can create diamond hard surfaces.
When the armor cells are reformatting the armor surface, a high electronic buzzing can sometimes be heard.
Armor panels can operate in three distinct modes

•	Power preservation: the nano-carbon powder is kept in place via electromagnetism. The powder appears to lie evenly spread out on the surface of the panel, but in reality, it held just a few micrometers above the surface.
•	Shaping: the nano-powder is “squashed” via electromagnetism until it turns into a pseudo-liquid phase. The liquid will almost instantly appear to be solid because it is kept in place by very strong magnetic forces.
•	Crystal: the carbon nano-powder is squashed even more and turns into one of a number of pseudo solid crystal phases. The properties of these crystal phases can be “selected” when formatting the state. Hardness, low electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity are the three primary properties to select between. A combat armor will usually be formatted for hardness as its primary attribute, with electrical protection as a secondary property. Most combat armors will try to format for a relatively high thermal conductivity to avoid over-heating the wearer.

Awesome power storage.

Batteries that can contain much more power than today.

Possibly á la Niling D-Sinks.

Gray armor that resembles elephant skin. It covers a person in its entirety, making that person to appear extremely large.
This extremely tough skin is powered by organic muscles, which are “fed” by a blood-connection with the human host.
The suit itself carries around 3 liters of blood. When not worn, the blood is infused with nutrients and oxygen via simple medical machinery.
When wearing skin suit, the host needs to be on a strict, but very caloric diet. The host may also need extra oxygen in his/her air to support high-stress and high-strain situations. Some suits have gills to assist with oxygenation, but these types of suits are more open to chemical attacks.

The special “lava” that can somehow interact with complex molecules such as proteins.

Inspiration: the “goo” that creates vomit zombies.

Swarm Monster.
Think Liloo from Fifth Element.
Also think of the humans infected by the Star Flyer from The Commonwealth ofSeries.
Beautiful, hard to kill, intelligent, independent, agents of The Swarm. They have special, hardcore DNA á la Fifth Element.
These agents have special DNA, but do not contain any swarm lava molecules.
They are not in direct communication with The Swarm.
They are able to act completely independently.
They are based on real humans:
	•	They can be created by reanimating a dead human, thus leaving the Angel without any memories (because of the brain death).
	•	They can be created by brainwashing (and genetically modifying) a living human - leaving the human with all original memories.
Angels have no feelings other than complete loyalty to The Swarm, but they are excellent at faking feelings.

Swarm Monster.
Inspiration: Vomit Zombie.

Breeder Reactors. (Reactors that generate new fissionable materials).

One of these: Liquid fluoride thorium reactor.

Fusion power and fusion propellant.

Large spaceships must be built in space.

Materials for ship hulls, etc. Mostly comes from asteroids, moons and other space-mining ventures.

Some spaceships are built out of hollowed-out asteroids. These are sometime called stoneskin ships.

Some ships have an asteroid core with "platforms" built on the surface. These are sometimes called stonecore ships. Stonecore ships often do mining operations while in space. Waste material can be used as propellant.
Some ships even use multiple small asterioids and comets to provide more material, fuel (helium-3 and other gasses), air and water.


Most cargo ships are often build like  |---|> the middle section has room for tens, hundreds or even thousands of containers.
Some containers have the ability to survive atmosphere entry as a kind of drop-pods.

MAD: Moon, Asteroid, Dwarf Planet.

MADs have low gravity, allowing large spaceships to land.

A little gravity is better than no gravity when it comes to humans.

They are quite large: allowing room for construction of large habitats.

MADs sometimes have usable resources (potable water, helium, hydrogen, etc.).

MADs rarely have dense atmospheres, simplifying space flight.

MADs sometimes have magnetospheres, protecting inhabitants from solar radiation, etc.

Adrenaline implants that make you go all-powerful of doom for a brief period of time.

After that you are totally wasted.

The more powerful the booster, the more wasted you are afterwards.
