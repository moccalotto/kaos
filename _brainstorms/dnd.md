Moon Druid
==========
### Close combat build with buff and healing spells

* I am a 
    * Gnome
    * Halfling
    * Dwarf
* I am quite overweight.
* I have some goblin in my ancestry.
* I am both proud and ashamed of my ancestry.
* My ancestry has caused me to get shunned by my
  my clan.
* I have found that nature provides.
* But lately I have also come to see that civilization
  has some awesome things to offer. For instance
  entertainment and alcohol.
* I find adventuring quite fascinating, and I do it
  more for the entertainment than the money.
* I do not save up money - I spend it on the 
  entertainment that the city can provide.


--------------------------------------------------


Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)
==========================

* I am a Tiefling.
* I hate my infernal background.
* I am in constant turmoil with myself.
* I feel a secret shame when I have to resort to 
  using my fiendish abilities.
* I want to take vengeance on any fiend who
  roams the land.
* Before being taken in by "the monastery",
  I was a very bad boy indeed. Because of the 
  burden of my fiendish background, I resorted 
  to drinking, mischief, causing trouble,
  adultery, sometimes even fighting.
* I now feel that I have found the right path,
  and I try to combat my infernal instincts as
  much as possible.
* Whenever I "fall of the wagon" and give in
  to temptation, I feel deeply ashamed and I 
  feel I must atone - generally causing my 
  mood to be sour until I get to fulfil that
  atonement (refer to the Oath of Vengeance).


--------------------------------------------------


Warlock (Pact of the Blade, The Fiend)
======================================
Close combat build with focus on con.

* I am a Hill Dwarf.
* I was shunned by my peers for being physically inept when
  I was very young.
* My biggest wish was to one day be great at wielding a weapon,
  so I could show my childhood bullies.
* I got my wish.
* My fiend lord granted me physical strength, a magical weapon,
  and a other powerful magical abilities.
* I soon used these abilities to cause terror among my 
  childhood bullies.
* After that, I was exiled.
* I have now realized that I have made en eternal pact with a
  monster; that every time I kill with magic or my blade, the
  victims soul is eaten by my lord. This weighs upon me.
* I try and keep up a good natured facade.
* I try to do good to compensate for the pact I made.
* I try to only kill monsters with my magic.
* I might end up drinking a bit too much as a kind of self-
  medication.
* Secretly I still want the powers granted me by my lord;
  I do not want to do its bidding, but I want the power.


--------------------------------------------------


Sorcerer (Wild Magic)
=====================

* I am a
    * Halfling (possibly a bit of goblin blood too)
    * Gnome with a crazy Einstein thing going on.
* I have lots of personality.
* I have a ton of fun.
* I go adventuring because it is interesting,
  not because it is profitable.

--------------------------------------------------


Warlock (Pact of the of the Tome, The Great Old One)
====================================================
* I am a gnome (Mark of Scribing, if allowed).
* I am clever.
* I am eccentric.
* I might have a touch of ADHD.
* I probably also have som mild autism.
* I don't like getting dirty.
* I don't like disorder and disorderly surroundings.
* In spite of my high CHA, I suck at dealing with 
  people in everyday conversation.
  I *can* do it, but if I do not make the effort
  and "pretend I care", my cold logic will often
  make me seem like a total douche.
* I don't really see the harm in allying 
  with a great old one. Especially because I
  use that alliance to do good.
* I'm more curious than frightened of my patron.
* I often think of myself as being more intelligent
  and cunning than my patron.
* I am intrigued to find out what my patron actually is,
  what its end-goals are, and how I might outsmart it.
