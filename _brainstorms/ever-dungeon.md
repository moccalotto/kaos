## Premise
The world consists on a single enormous city and a never-ending, living dungeon underneath it.

Adventurers have to go into the dungeon to find or harvest food for the citizens.

Sometimes rare treasure is found as well.

There are monsters a plenty, but they never enter the city for some reason.
