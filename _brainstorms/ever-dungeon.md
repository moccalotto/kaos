## Premise

The world consists on a single enormous city and a never-ending, living dungeon underneath it.

This campaign would be ideal as a fantasy setting, but could be adapted for other styles
such as modern, futuristic, cyberpunk, steampunk, etc.

The dungeon is a bit like the city in Blame!

The city is enormous. Beyond the city walls something really bad. Maybe the city is
inside a protective bubble inside one of the elemental planes or some demonic plane
of existence. Maybe its just lava all round.

Adventurers have to go into the dungeon to find or harvest food for the citizens.

Sometimes rare treasure is found as well.

Sometimes a so-called land-shard is found. Land-shards can be used to expand the city, making more room for citizens.

The city has huge towers to accomodate all the citizens.

There are monsters a plenty, but they never enter the city for some reason.

Technically the ever dungeon campaign could work in any type of genre (steam punk, high fantasy, cyberpunk, superhero).

Citizens can be outcast into the dungeon. There are communities and villages of non-monsters that survive in the dungeon.

A citizen can be outcast by magic such that they cannot enter the city again.

Sometimes the dungeon changes. It happens every few months, years and/or decades. After such shifts the dungeon
becomes more or less unrecognizable and adventurers must yet again map out the areas and clear the monsters.

There are many rumors about what happens to adventures caught in the dungeon when it shifts.

There are rumors that if you go far enough, you might eventually come to other cities.

The city is riddled with conflict, politics and drama. Guilds constantly compete for power and resources.
it is usually the adventuerers that suffer when the rich and powerful citizens compete against each other.

For instance, adventurers have to *pay* to get/accept quests. Only if they return will they get their deposit back
as well as the reward.

If adventurers bring loot up top that is not directly sanctioned via a quest, it is heavily taxed.
