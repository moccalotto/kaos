## Premise

The world consists on a single enormous city and a never-ending, living dungeon underneath it.

The dungeon is a bit like the city in Blame!

The city is enormous. Beyond the city walls something really bad. Maybe the city is
inside a protective bubble inside one of the elemental planes or some demonic plane
of existence. Maybe its just lava all round.

Adventurers have to go into the dungeon to find or harvest food for the citizens.

Sometimes rare treasure is found as well.

Sometimes a so-called land-shard is found. Land-shards can be used to expand the city, making more room for citizens.

The city has huge towers to accomodate all the citizens.

There are monsters a plenty, but they never enter the city for some reason.

Technically the ever dungeon campaign could work in any type of genre (steam punk, high fantasy, cyberpunk, superhero).
