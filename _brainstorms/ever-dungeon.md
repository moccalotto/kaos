# The Premise

The world consists on an enormous medieval city with a never-ending, living
dungeon underneath it. The city is surrounded by an endless Forest on three
sides and black Void to the north; venturing into either is fatal, so procuring
resources from the Dungeon is the only way for the City to survive.

The history of the City, reason it is where it is, why the Dungeon is there,
and what the Forest and the Void are is not really understood. It is said that
the world was crushed by an angry god, and that the City was the only thing
that survived. Scholars speculate that the Forest is the remnants of a long
dead god of nature, and that the Void is a gate to the heavens. None of these
hypotheses have been confirmed.

**Designer's Note:** While this is high fantasy setting, it could easily be
adapted for other styles such as modern, futuristic, cyberpunk, steampunk,
superhero, etc. The cataclysmic background could be caused by an AI
singularity, warfare, aliens, etc., and magic could be replaced with advanced
technology.


# The City

The city is enormous; most citizens live in very tall buildings, and the more
rich and powerful of course live in the top floors. Some towers and buildings
are 10 stories tall or more. The tallest stands 19 stories tall.

Magic is used to assist in the creation and maintenance of these buildings,
along with their supporting infrastructure such as elevators, walkways, etc.

There are walkways high up on the outside of most buildings in the more wealthy
neighbourhoods. These walkways, called top streets or sky streets, are usually
not connected directly to the street level, ensuring that only people who have
access to the top levels (i.e. the rich) can access the top streets.

A tall and very wide wall surrounds the city to keep the hostile Forest at bay.
If these magically reinforced walls weren't there, the trees of the Forest
would invade and directly attack the City and its inhabitants. The walls are
usually patrolled, although not because the Forest would actively engage the
walls because of their defensive magic, but to ensure that no miscreants try
and climb over the walls, and possibly provoke the creatures of the Forest.
Because on very rare occasions, these enterprising citizens have been thrown
back over the wall with such force as to kill citizens splat all over the
place, and sometimes even damaging buildings. Who or what tosses the citizens
back over the wall is not really understood, nor is the reason behind it.

The City can be expanded by so-called Land-Shards. These rare artifacts can
only be found in the Dungeon. They are magical devices that can drive away the
Forest and, for a short time, expose an area of raw bedrock. The city workers
must then in all haste construct a temporary magical bulwark against the
Forest. After that, a more permanent wall can be constructed. And only then can
the area be used as part of the City proper.

Because of the incremental expansion of the City, and the constant need to have
an outer wall, many buildings have been build using the former City wall as 
part of their structure. It is not uncommon to see long tall buildings where one
side was once the outer wall of the city.


## The Pit and Pit City

The main entrance to the dungeon is an almost 700 meter deep cone shaped hole
with extremely steep sides made of Bedrock. At the bottom is a village called
Pit City where the tough guys hang out. In order to get into or out of the Put,
one must use a series of elevators. Near the bottom of the pit, in the sides of
the walls holes, which are the actual entrances to the Dungeon. In order to
access most entrances, one must take other elevators and/or do some climbing.

Pit City is a tent village that is the main staging area for entering the
Dungeon. The only main builds are an inn, a smithy, a few general stores and a
store for basic magical supplies. Other than that, there are some public
latrines and an area for tents. Pit City is sometimes attacked by Dungeon
Denizens, however, such attacks are almost always repelled by the people of Pit
City. For this reason, the land in Pit City is not taxed in any way. The
proprietor of the inn serves as the de facto mayor of Pit City, and the owner
of the smith is the second in command.


## Edgetown

The eastern edge of the City borders up against the Void, which is essentially
equivalent to outer space. It is as if the bedrock simply drops away. Anyone
who has gone over the edge, willingly or not, have never been seen again. Some
people claim to have seen lights, or even creatures flying out there, but this
has not been confirmed by reliable sources.

Since real estate is at a premium in the City, enterprising people have built a
scaffold on clinging onto the buildings and wall along the edge of the Void.
This scaffolding has over the years grown into a little town, called Edgetown.
This town is known for its high crime rate; the City Constables do not patrol it,
and they rarely venture out there, even during hot pursuit.


## The Bedrock

The bedrock on which the city stands is an extremely hard crystalline material
that seems living in many ways. It requires the highest level of magic to
pierce it. Furthermore it regenerates any damage done to it, often within hours
or days.

Most attempts to massively dig down has resulted in exposing the city directly
to very dangerous areas of the Dungeon.

There seem to be no clear correlation between where you dig down and which area
of the Dungeon is exposed. This is most likely due to the magical and chaotic
nature of the Dungeon.

When erecting walls and buildings, special care must be taken to make the
foundations of the building adhere to the bedrock. This is usually done with a
kind of glue made from slime- and tar monsters from the Dungeon.

## Resources

The city has almost no resources; there is no mining due to the special nature
of the bedrock, and farming can only be undertaken with dirt collected in the
Dungeon, so Spelunkers have to go into the Dungeon to find or harvest these
essential resources for the City.

### Food

The vast majority of food comes from the Dungeon. Meats from various monsters
are highly valued. Fungi can be harvested from certain areas in the Dungeon and
are also highly valued. The citizens are able to grow certain crops on roof
tops and balconies (if they get enough light). Many citizens also grow their
own herbs and spices in their own homes. However, many spices can only be
obtained in the Dungeon as it turns out that certain monster parts are
themselves quite spicy and tasty. Certain molds are also very tasty, and
sometimes adventurers will find special nutritional plants in the Dungeon that
are both high in nutrients and taste. Some plants and fungi can even be used in
baking, replacing wheat and oats.

Some citizens do have farm animals for slaughter and milk, but these are few
and very expensive to keep. 

Salt can be found in the Dungeon in areas where the bedrock gives way to
mundane rock and allow water to deposit minerals.

To really vary the types, variety and quality of food, citizens rely heavily on
magic. Many mages can make a decent living simply by spicing up, and even
transmuting the food that is gathered in the Dungeon.

Monsters often posses foods that are not normally found in the Dungeon. For
instance, some tribes of dark elves, cave giants, and orcs sometimes possess
cheeses, baked goods, veal-like meats, and even alcoholic beverages. It is a
great source of mystery how these tribes obtain such riches.

Because food is scarce, nothing is wasted. Scraps and waste food is sold to
people who have farm animals that can eat them, and bones and sinews are sold
to various types of craftspersons.

### Water

The Dungeon is home to many lakes and streams. The main trouble is that these
often serve as watering holes for a number of monsters. Some caves and caverns
have water dripping from the ceilings or slowly condensing on the walls. Some
spelunkers make a living by collecting that water. Even though it is a slow
process, it is relatively safe and it only requires a few simple containers.

Magic and alchemy can be used to purify water and even distil water from blood
and other fluids.


### Metal

The Dungeon is the only source of metal available. For some reason, many
monsters carry weapons and other gear containing metal. Where they get it is a
mystery as no adventurers have ever found any mines operated by monsters.

Certain monsters have metal-like hides, bones and teeth. These are very
valuable. Additionally, magic can be used to transmute bone and certain monster
scales, claws, and bones into metal, but these methods are quite time consuming
and expensive.

Sometimes raw ores can be mined from certain areas of the Dungeon, but this is
very dangerous and will require guards and lookouts because of the noise. Such
mines are always temporary because of the shifts the Dungeon regularly
undergoes. Moreover smelting raw ore can be a very fuel consuming and polluting
process, making ore much less desirable than metal that has already been
refined.

Magic and alchemy is heavily employed to smelt, refine, harden, anneal, and
otherwise treat metals. Magic is also used to transmute metals and minerals,
although this is expensive.


### Stone

As with metal, stone can be mined from certain areas of the Dungeon. Some
monsters also carry stone. Certain monster parts can be transmuted into stone
by magic.


### Wood

As with metal, the Dungeon is the only real source of wood for tools and fuel.
Some monsters have wooden tools and weapons from which the woods can be
salvaged. On rare occasions "wooden" monsters such as treants can be
encountered. Such monsters are highly valuable.

Magic is heavily used to create wood from bone.

Enterprising adventurers have tried going out into the Forest, but these never
come back if traveling out of sight of the City.


### Fuel

Most wood found in the Dungeon is used to craft items, furniture, etc. Certain
inedible monster parts are sometimes dried out and turned into "charcoal" to be
used as fuel. Moreover, a number of monsters have fat, blubber, and oil
deposits that can be used as fuel.

Some other-worldly monsters such as fire elementals and salamanders can be
harnessed as sources of heat.

As with wood and metal, some intelligent monsters carry fuel sources such as
oil, coal and charcoal. Where they these fuel sources is a mystery.

Fires are always utilized as much as possible; Whenever a fire is lit, one
would smoke meats in the chimney, cook something and/or heat stones to
preserve the heat for later use. Many people also create their own charcoal
whenever they light fires.


## Taxes

There are no sales- or income taxes as such, but all land must be leased from
the City. The price of leasing a building varies greatly depending on the
price, location and condition of the building. The price also varies depending
on the purpose the lease. For instance, leasing a building with the purpose of
common housing is cheaper than leasing it to be used as a public house - at
least in certain areas. The city council can designate an area to be used for a
given purpose; if you lease a property to be used for anything other than that
purpose, your lease will be higher. The leaseholder can get a rebate if she
refurbishes the building. The city may also provide some financing for such
purposes.

The most expensive type of lease is the type where you lease a building with
the only purpose of living in it yourself.

The City also levies the use of cranes and elevators that transport people
and goods to/from the Dungeon.

The most complicated parts of the city monetary infrastructure is the guild
system. The guilds basically take a cut of every transaction, and they do what
they can to ensure that as many transactions as possible take place before
goods from the Dungeon reach the common citizens. Some amount of corruption has
infected this system. To make it even more complicated, the City does not have
to pay any guild taxes when it purchases goods and services from any guild member;
this means that there is quite a lot of paper work going on.

## The People

### Spelunkers

Spelunkers make a living in the Dungeon in some way. This may be as miners,
guides, explorers, or just old school adventurers. Spelunkers have a strange
position in society; they are seen as both valiant heroes and dirty workers at
the same time. And since the average life span of a spelunker is very short,
they usually have trouble finding spouses. However, veteran spelunkers often
have a chance at reaching good societal standings.

### Nobility

§§§ Birth right, etc.


### City Constabulary

The city constables are the City's only police force. Their jurisdiction is
solely aboveground, and does not include Edgetown and Pit City.  Constables are
not paid especially well, but they are given adequate housing in the
constabulary barracks, they are well fed, and they have no other duties.
Moreover, it is seen as a sign of patriotism to have served as a constable.  On
top of all this, some constables take bribes and use their positions, to gain
favors from influential people. For these reasons, many people especially young
males, choose to server e few years in the constabulary.  However, mainly two
types of people stay on for life: the truly good and the deeply corrupt; The
corrupt stay on for the money and influence, and the good stay on to make a
difference in the city and in the constabulary.

The most typical employee in the constabulary is a constable, but other professions
are also represented. For instance, the constabulary employs lawyers, clerks,
smiths, couriers, and even mages.


#### Mages

Mages are essential to the City; they can purify and improve the resources and
materiel extracted from the Dungeon; they can prevent and even cure disease;
they can make food last longer; they can assist in the construction of
everything from large buildings to tiny tools.


#### Healers 

§§§ (clerics) can make a good living by healing, creating food, creating and
purifying water, and other societal goods.


#### Importers

Importers are a special kind of merchant that trade directly with spelunkers to
purchase the products and materials from the Dungeon. Importers then sell on
such products to the crafters and merchants of the City. The Importers Guild
often commission the finding of certain materials. Some crafters are also
importers. However this means that the crafter will have to pay for memberships
in both the Crafters guild and the Importers guild.

#### Crafters

A crafter or craftsman is a person that is engaged in the industries of the
city. Craftsmen usually trade with merchants and importers, but may also trade
with spelunkers directly.


#### Merchants

As a rule, merchants are the only type of vendor that can deal with the public.
Crafters may only sell their goods to merchants, and merchants usually sell
their goods to the public. A crafter (or importer) that sells anything directly
to the public will have to a) be a member of the Merchants guild or b) pay a
hefty fee for doing so.


### The Guilds

#### Importers Guild

#### Merchants Guild

#### Mages Guild

#### Templars Guild

#### Crafters Guild

### Optional Theme: Conflicted City

The city is riddled with conflict, corruption, politics and drama. Guilds
constantly compete for power and resources. It is usually the adventurers that
suffer when the rich and powerful citizens compete against each other. For
instance, adventurers have to *pay* to get/accept quests. Only if they return
will they get their deposit back as well as the reward.

If adventurers bring loot up top that is not directly sanctioned via a quest,
it is heavily taxed by the guilds. Adventurers risk having their possessions
taxed more than once if they do not have the correct paper work. When you enter
the Dungeon you get a receipt of your equipment, and anything you bring back
other than the stated equipment is taxed. You do not get a rebate in case of
lost or expended equipment.

# The Dungeon

The Dungeon is a bit like the city in Blame!

Is there a dungeon core?

Do we need to explain anything, or is it up to the GM ?
