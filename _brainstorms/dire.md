Setting: space opera with magic 'n stuff.

## Inspiration:
* Steampunk.
* God Engines.
* Titansgrave RPG.
* Starwars (mostly the alliance).


There are cyborgs and other races that are possibly the products of
long-ago magical manipulation or genetic tampering.

Interstellar travel is not available to the playable races.
Certain space demons may come from outside the solar system
or even outside the galaxy.

There is more than one inhabitable planet, however only one
planet that fully supports all life. The other planet is mostly
a mining-planet where orks, trolls and dwarves compete for resources.
The asteroid belt around the mining planet is rife with strife (ding ding)

Movie clips:

* A mage using his magic to launch a projectile รก la a railgun,
  setting the atmosphere on fire, creating a small storm, and obliterating
  a shuttle parked in low orbit.
* A spaceship captain having a battle of wills with the demon that powers her spaceship.
* An asteroid inhabited by dwarf miners.
* Mages performing a ritual that jumps their ship out of the way of a space torpedo.
* Mages performing a ritual to safely launch their spaceshit from the ground into orbit.
* Magis performing a ritual to slowly and safely drop cargo from low orbit onto a
  special loading platform off the coast of a large town.
* The in-space construction of a spaceship made of wood, metal and mostly stone.
* The summonning and enslavement of a demon, binding it to a partially constructed ship.
* The summoning of elementals to provide the ship with water, air and heat.
* The summining of elementals to power space torpedoes.
* Combat mages (warriors with limited magical ability) jumping
  from a shuttle in low orbit, using magic instead of parachutes
  and to shield them from the heat of atmosphering entry.
* Creatures like the cyber zombies of doom, quake, etc.
* A fleet of evil looking ships, decorated with skulls and bones and crewed by dark elves in black leather armors.
