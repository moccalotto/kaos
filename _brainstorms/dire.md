Setting: space opera with magic 'n stuff.

## Inspiration:
* Steampunk.
* God Engines.
* Titansgrave RPG.
* Starwars (mostly the alliance).



There are cyborgs and other races that are possibly the products of
long-ago magical manipulation or genetic tampering.

Movie clips:

* A mage using his magic to launch a projectile รก la a railgun,
  setting the atmosphere on fire, creating a small storm, and obliterating
  a shuttle parked in low orbit.
* A spaceship captain having a battle of wills with the demon that powers her spaceship.
* Mages performing rituals to job their ships many light years.
* Combat mages (warriors with limited magical ability) jumping
  from a shuttle in low orbit, using magic instead of parachutes
  and to shield them from the heat of atmosphering entry.
* Creatures like the cyber zombies of doom, quake, etc.
* Some people wear leather armors.
