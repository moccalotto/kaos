Setting: space opera with magic 'n stuff.

## Inspiration:
* Steampunk.
* God Engines.
* Titansgrave RPG.
* Starwars (mostly the alliance).



There are cyborgs and other races that are possibly the products of
long-ago magical manipulation or genetic tampering.

Movie clips:

* A mage using his magic to launch a projectile รก la a railgun,
  setting the atmosphere on fire, creating a small storm, and obliterating
  a shuttle parked in low orbit.
* A spaceship captain having a battle of wills with the demon that powers her spaceship.
* An asteroid inhabited by dwarf miners.
* Mages performing a ritual that jumps their ship out of the way of a space torpedo.
* Mages performing a ritual to safely launch their spaceshit from the ground into orbit.
* Magis performing a ritual to slowly and safely drop cargo from low orbit onto a
  special loading platform off the coast of a large town.
* The in-space construction of a spaceship made of wood, metal and mostly stone.
* The summonning and enslavement of a demon, binding it to a partially constructed ship.
* The summoning of elementals to provide the ship with water, air and heat.
* The summining of elementals to power space torpedoes.
* Combat mages (warriors with limited magical ability) jumping
  from a shuttle in low orbit, using magic instead of parachutes
  and to shield them from the heat of atmosphering entry.
* Creatures like the cyber zombies of doom, quake, etc.
* Some people wear leather armors.
