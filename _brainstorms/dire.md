## Overview
The world Attafala was the origin of the human race.
About a hundred and fifty years ago, the Vraii (also called demons) sent hundreds
of powerful magic-users to Attafala disguised as humans.
These Vraii agents proceeded to infiltrate the world and prepare a giant ritual
that would tear large chunks, or shards, of the surface off of Attafala and send
them into Wrakath, the universe of the Vraii. The infiltration took about eight years.

About two hundred shards were transported. Some of the shards were as large as continents,
others as small as a few square kilometers.

The Vraii enchanted the shards in such a way that they would sustain life.
The shards had gravity, atmosphere and even clouds and rainfall.
The Vraii even bound powerful fire elementals to the shards so as to create sunlight.

The Vraii intended to use the humans as slaves and even livestock.
But Maree, originally a school teacher,
* BECAME AWESOME AND POWERFUL SOMEHOW.
* BANISHED THE DEMONS FROM HER HOME SHARD.
* USED THE BLOOD AND LIFE FORCE OF CAPTURED DEMON AGENTS
TO EMPOWER HER FELLOW HUMANS WITH MAGIC.
* CREATED MAGICAL SPACE SHIPS BY BINDING ELEMENTALS AND
CAPTURED DEMONS TO THEM.
* CREATED AN ARMY AND FREED MOST OF THE OTHER SHARDS.

When the Vraii designed their ritual, they completely disregarded borders and territories,
causing the shards to be inhabited by nations and cultures that were both scattered across
the universe and not prepared to co-exist on the suddenly reduced space available.
Eventually, Maree would unite the humans, but some cultural tension still lingers.

About fifteen years ago, explorers discovered the Orracca (basically orks).
