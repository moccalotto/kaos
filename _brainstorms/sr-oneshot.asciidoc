= SR OneShot

== Monsters

Cyber Zombies::
Basically stupid versions of borgs. Metahumans that have been infected with digital chaos.
Once in a while there are zombie bosses that have some intelligence - these have been 
genetically altered and have tons of cyberware. Beware huge badass troll cyber samurai.

Cyber Plants::
    PLants that have merged with infected technology.

Cyber Dogs::
    Dogs and wolves that have been genetically enlarged and then infected with digital chaos.

Cyber Mage::
    Technomancer on steroids. One of the only ranged combatants in the one-shot.
