Oneshot scenarios
=================

Demons
------
Players are demons รก la ash vs evil dead.
They are likely posessing real humans, but give their
hosts badass powers.
Their mission is to pave the way for the evil overlord.
If killed, they can possibly respawn if they have gathered enough power.
This could also be a long-lived campaign.

Summoned Spawn
--------------
Players are summoned creatures (for instance imps).
Their mission is to somehow kill their sumonner.
By changing the mission objective, this one-shot could be
turned into a more long-lived campaign.


Zombie Hunters
--------------
Players are zombie hunters.
They have attributes like Cool (to do cool stuff and keep cool),
Feral (to go berserk and possibly do extreme stuff),
Ammo (to always have more ammo and not run out)
and Skill (to do stuff if any of the other attributes don't apply)


Aliens
------
Players are aliens invading a space ship.
Their objective is to overtake it and prepare as many humans
as possible for their queen to lay eggs in.
