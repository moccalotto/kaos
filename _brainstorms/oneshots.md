Oneshot scenarios

1. Players are demons (รก la ash vs evil dead)
   Their mission is to pave the way for the
   evil overlord.
   If killed, they can possibly respawn if
   the have gathered enough power.
2. Players are summoned creatures (for instance imps).
   Their mission is to somehow kill their sumonner.
3. Players are zombie hunters. They have attributes
   like Cool (to do cool stuff and keep cool),
   Extreme (to go berserk and possibly do extreme stuff),
   Ammo (to always have more ammo and not run out) and
   Skill (to do stuff if any of the other attributes don't apply)
