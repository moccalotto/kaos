    <h2 id="estara">Estara</h2>

<h3 id="there-is-no-light">There is no light</h3>

<p>The ring mountain aurora illuminates and heats all of Estara at all times;
there is no night, dawn, dusk or day.</p>

<p>The farther away you get from the ring mountains, the colder it gets and the
less light you can see from the right mountains. On the Vast White however the
permanent layer of ice more than compensates for lower light intensity. In
fact, it is extremely important to protect your eyes while on the Vast White.</p>

<h2 id="arion">Arion</h2>

<p>Arion is an alliance of free city states. All citizens of the Arion alliance
are free; there are no slaves, bondsmen, indentured servants or similar. There
are no castes or other legally defined social strata. There are social classes,
but these are fluid and are affected by wealth and fame more than hereditary or
marriage.</p>

<p>All cities within the alliance must adhere to the Code of Arion, which
generally states all intelligent life is free and must never be enslaved,
indentured or bonded.  It also has rules and guidelines for taxation,
imprisonment, exhile and even capital punishment.  But mostly the Code of Arion
focuses on the Elects, their function and what they represent.</p>

<h3 id="elects-masters-and-ministers">Elects, Masters and Ministers</h3>

<p>Once every 3000 days (on a day called the Day of Choosing), any town of at
least 50 adult persons must choose a candidate elect.  Cities with at least 500
citizens must choose 2 elects, cities with at least 5000 citizens must choose 3
elects and so on.  For every candidate chosen, the towns may also choose one
secondary candidate.  This candidate can be used if the primary candidate is
deemed unsuited to become an elect.</p>

<p>Each town or city in the alliance has its very own day of choosing such that
there is always a steady stream of new candidate elects.</p>

<p>As soon as they have been chosen, primary and secondary candidates travel Arios
to be tested and judged by the Council of Masters.  The types of tests a
candidates undergo is unique to each candidate.  Most candidates are evaluated
on ideological, philosophical and psychological grounds, but some also need to
prove themselves physically. The tests can last anywhere from a few hours to a
few weeks. The tests are not necessarily fair or even. However, if a set of
masters make unreasonable requests of a candidate elect, the Council of
Ministers can veto the test and make the masters come up with a new test for
the candidate.</p>

<p>The Council of Masters judge whether a candidate is suited as an elect or not,
and they also judge which type of Elect the candidate is most suited for.</p>

<p>When the candidate has become an Elect, he/she travels around Arion for at
least 10 years, doing their duty and serving the Code of Arion.</p>

<p>It is customary for the Elects to visit the home town of the Master that
“approved” them within the first year after being approved.</p>

<p>Elects are to be given shelter provisions as needed by the townships they
serve.  Elects are honor bound to not exploit the hospitality and resources of
the townships.  Elects must keep journals with daily updates.  While traveling,
such updates need not be detailed, but updates while staying in townships must
be detailed about where (as in which building) the Elect stayed and for how
long, and what they were given to eat. Of course the journal must also contain
detailed descriptions of the elects activities while in the township.</p>

<p>Every year, the elect must travel to Arios to hand in his/her personal journal,
and to get a new one.  The journals have magical properties - they will not
easily burn, freeze, rot, get wet, etc.  Moreover, whatever is entered into it
cannot be erased by any non magical means.</p>

<p>When an elect has served the Code of Arion for at least 10 years, he/she can
apply for a promotion to either Minister or Master.  The Elect can apply to
each position once every year.</p>

others if it is necessary for the overall peace and well being</p>

<ul>

  <li>Must ensure that citizens and townships are properly prepared against attacks from monsters and/or invaders.</li>
