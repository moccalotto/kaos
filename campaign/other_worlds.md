## Other Worlds

One *can* fly over the ring mountains by non-magical means such as riding
dragons, flying hot air balloons or using zeppelins.  Hot air balloons can be
powered by elementals, but only if they have been portalled into the world and
remain here willingly; summoned elementals will disappear or go on a rampage as
soon as they get near the mountains because the summoning spell will unravel.

Estara is like an asteriod in an astral plane where a number of similar worlds
float around like islands in a sea of glowing mist.  The asteroidal worlds are
flat on top and cone shaped underneath.  Often populated, each asteroid is tiny
world with their own culture and sometimes unique races.  It is speculated that
all or at least many of the worlds were formerly parts of the original world of
the Estaran continent.  In the cloud-world, air balloon travel is quite common,
as the winds are mild and it enables relatively safe travel from island to
island.  Estara is the biggest of all of the worlds - and it is the only one
with ring mountains and an permanent aura of raw magical power.
