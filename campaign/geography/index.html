    <p>
    The campaign takes place in an area that was formerly known as the Estaran Continent; an ancient empire that spanned an entire continent from coast to coast.
</p>

<p>
    This continent was home to a single vast empire called the Estaran Empire; a somewhat degenerate theocracy where the priests of elder god Zhe ruled the vassal countries with iron fists.
</p>

<p>
    Centuries ago, Zhe attempted to destroy the entire world, devouring the sun and the moons and hammering its giant fist into the center of the Estaran Continent, where the grandest temple of Zhe was located.
</p>

<p>
    The entire world shattered in an event simply known as “Zhe’s Apocalypse” in later times.
</p>

<p>
    However, all was not completely lost; Zhe’s offspring, the lesser gods, sacrificed themselves to save the remnants of the world. They bled their celestial blood onto the world in an effort to save some of it and the life thereon.
</p>




    
        <h4><a href="/places/arion/">Arion</a></h4>
        <p>Arion was a new, and thus unwilling, addition to the Estarian empire.
Many of its people were taken as slaves to serve in mines in the far south-east or as
labor in the construction of temples to Zhe in the region.</p>


    

    

    
        <h4><a href="/places/plains/">The Plains</a></h4>
        <p>Southern neighbour Arion.
This was possibly the most unruly and diversely populated region of Estara.
The population of the plains was heavily culled for slave labour in the pre-apocalypse days.
The Plains are now populated by tribal communities á la “village states”.
The tribal leaders have close communications with each other and all strive for unity
to be able to combat any invasion by the Wraith or even by Tyathia.
The Tribes of The Plains have adopted a code very similar to The Code of Arion to be able
to The tribes of The Plains are closely allied with Arion because they see Arion as a
buffer between them and Tyathia.
Even so, Tyathia has previously launched a naval army to try and capture certain
areas of The Plains - however, a united front of warriors from the tribes
repelled the invasion with the aid of weaponry and battle equipment purchased and
loaned from Arion.</p>

    

    
        <h4><a href="/places/ring-mountains/">The Ring Mountains</a></h4>
        <p>The current area now known as Estara is the remnants of the Estaran Continent.
But it is no longer encompassed by oceans, but by impossibly tall mountains,
simply called the Ring Mountains.</p>


    

    
        <h4><a href="/places/taransak/">Taransak</a></h4>
        <p>Also known as the “The city of magic”, this city states resides inside the south western part
of of the Arion territory, although it is not a part of the Arion alliance.</p>


    

    
        <h4><a href="/places/tyathia/">Tyathia</a></h4>
        <p>This eastward neighboar of Arion still adhere the ruthless and decadent ways of the Estaran Empire.</p>


    

    
        <h4><a href="/places/vast-white/">Vast White</a></h4>
        <p>THe vast white is the largest body of water in Estara. It covers the entire center of the
Estaran continent and is covered in ice that is up to 200 meters thick.</p>
