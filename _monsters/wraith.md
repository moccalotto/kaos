How the original cultists of zhe somehow survived and started the Zhe Nation on the plateau of Zhe in the middle of The Great White.
Many types of wraith:


**High Priests**:
Ã¼ber powerful psionic power users.

**Priests**:
Not defined yet.

**Templars**:
Deadly fighters who regenerate. They usually wield two handed swords and have modified toughened skin that serves as armor.

**Rogues**:
Fast, stealthy, deadly assassins.

**Agents**: Shape shifters / doppelgangers who are able to blend into society. They are even able to talk and produce noise (although they hate it).
agents have limited charm person abilities.

**Ghouls**: failed their initiation rite and became almost mindless killing machines.
Ghouls are usually loners whom the Wraiths put out into the Great White.
