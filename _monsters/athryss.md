Originally summoned from a now-dead world, the Athryss are a special breed of docile
mamal that are extremely susceptible to magical alteration and manipulation.

During infancy, Athryss can be modified to become one of a variety of sub-species.
Although only unaltered athryss are able to reproduce.

Only the spell casters of the Tyathian empire have the exact knowledge of how to
manipulate the Athryss. Many magical scholars suspect that demonic magic is used.
It is also speculated that eating the meat of a modified Athryss may cause magical
side effects or possibly increase the likelyhood of having magically adept offspring.
