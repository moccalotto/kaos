### Demons

When the gods died, most of some of their realms still survived.
For instance, all the elemental universes survived, as did some of the realms of the dead.
Many of the "hells" collapsed, releasing a lot of demons into the world.
These demons now live in the Ring Mountains. It is said that the demons interbred
with various humanoid species, creating demon half-breeds.

All kinds of demons... all the stuff about how they fell from the now destroyed realms of kaos, etc.
(Zhe nuked the planes of kaos before actually nuking the world)

Heavily inspired by Seven Deadly Sins, demons are extremely powerful. Demon blood can cause mutations and give extreme powers.
Weapons and Armors can be made of demon bits.
I will also draw inspiration from "Son of the black sword".


### Wraiths
How the original cultists of zhe somehow survived and started the Zhe Nation on the plateau of Zhe in the middle of The Great White.
Many types of wraith:


**High Priests**:
Ã¼ber powerful psionic power users.

**Priests**:
Not defined yet.

**Templars**:
Deadly fighters who regenerate. They usually wield two handed swords and have modified toughened skin that serves as armor.

**Rogues**:
Fast, stealthy, deadly assassins.

**Agents**: Shape shifters / doppelgangers who are able to blend into society. They are even able to talk and produce noise (although they hate it).
agents have limited charm person abilities.

**Ghouls**: failed their initiation rite and became almost mindless killing machines.
Ghouls are usually loners whom the Wraiths put out into the Great White.
