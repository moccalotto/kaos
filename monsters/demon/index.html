    <p>When the gods died, most of some of their realms still survived.
For instance, all the elemental universes survived, as did some of the realms of the dead.
Many of the “hells” collapsed, releasing a lot of demons into the world.
These demons now live in the Ring Mountains. It is said that the demons interbred
with various humanoid species, creating demon half-breeds.</p>

<p>All kinds of demons… all the stuff about how they fell from the now destroyed realms of chaos, etc.
(Zhe nuked the planes of chaos before actually nuking the world)</p>

<p>Heavily inspired by Seven Deadly Sins, demons are extremely powerful. Demon blood can cause mutations and give extreme powers.
Weapons and Armors can be made of demon bits.
I will also draw inspiration from “Son of the black sword”.</p>

<p>Some demons may have absorbed the essence of their overlord deity by ingesting or absorbing
one or more god shards. These demons become Arch Demons and are extremely power, almost godlike (think Tarasque).</p>
