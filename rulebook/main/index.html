  <div class="post-content">
    <p>KAOS is a set of lightweight tabletop rpg guidelines
designed for for experienced and creative gamers, who have the confidence
and common sense to use a system that does not have rules for every
conceivable scenario.</p>

<p>Round fractions down,
modify the rules,
use common sense,
<em>Have Fun!</em>.</p>

<h1 id="characters">Characters</h1>
<p>Before you begin creating your character,
make sure you have read this document in its entirety.</p>

<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>
<p>There are six attributes that quantify a KAOS character:</p>

<p><strong>Strength</strong> (STR),
<strong>Agility</strong> (AGI),
<strong>Toughness</strong> (TOU),
<br />
<strong>Perception</strong> (PER),
<strong>Willpower</strong> (WIL),
and <strong>Charisma</strong> (CHA).</p>

<p>Distribute 100 points between these six attributes,
assigning at least 5 and at most 30 points to each attribute.</p>

<h2 id="race">Race</h2>
<p>Having chosen your attribute scores, the second thing to choose is your race.
Your race will determine how many <em>skill points</em> you will have and
how many <em>starting gold</em> pieces you have. Certain races improve your
attributes further and also grant your character special abilities.</p>

<p>To see which races you can choose, refer to the
<a href="/kaos/rulebook/races/">list of races</a>.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
<p>The third thing to do is to choose your skill scores by spending a number of your <em>skill points</em>.
Skills have a <em>base score</em> and a <em>max score</em>, and your starting skill score must be within one of those two
limits.</p>

<h4 id="base-score">Base Score</h4>
<p>You get the Base Score for free. You can improve your skills further by spending <em>skill points</em>.
For every skill point spent you can increase one skill score by one point.</p>

<h4 id="max-score">Max Score</h4>
<p>You cannot advance Skill Scores beyond their max score.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>Acrobatics</em> skill has a base score of STR ÷ 2 and a max score of STR + AGI.
A character with STR 21 and AGI 15 would have a base score of 21÷2=10 in <em>Acrobatics</em>,
and would be able to increase that skill to 21+15=36 by spending 26 skill points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Refer to the <a href="/kaos/rulebook/skills/">skill list</a>
for a comprehensive overview of all available skills.</p>

<h4 id="languages">Languages</h4>
<p>Characters can speak their native language and a number
of additional languages equal to their <a href="/kaos/rulebook/skills/#languages">Languages</a>
score divided by 10.  Likewise, characters can read and write a number of languages equal to
their <a href="/kaos/rulebook/skills/#literacy">Literacy</a> score divided by 10.</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<p>You can buy equipment with the Gold Pieces (GP) granted by your race.
No matter how much money is left over from buying your starting equipment,
your character begins play with a number of GP equal to their CHA.</p>

<p>Take a look at the
<a href="/kaos/rulebook/equipment/">equipment list</a>.
for more information about
the equipment you can purchase.</p>

<h1 id="the-dice-and-the-game">The Dice and The Game</h1>
<p>To find out if an action succeeds, you roll 1d100 versus a given <em>target number</em>.
You succeed if the result of this <em>test</em> comes up lower-than or equal to that target number.</p>

<h4 id="standard-tests">Standard Tests</h4>
<p>Roll 1d100 vs. the target number.
A target number can be a skill score, an attribute score, or something entirely different
determined by the GM.</p>

<h4 id="easy-tests">Easy Tests</h4>
<p>Make two Standard Tests against the target number You succeed if one of the tests succeed.</p>

<h4 id="hard-tests">Hard Tests</h4>
<p>Make two Standard Tests against the target number You succeed if both tests succeed.</p>

<h4 id="harder-and-easier">Harder and Easier</h4>
<p>Circumstances can affect the difficulty of tests;
a Standard Test that is made <em>harder</em> by circumstances becomes a Hard Test.
Conversely, a Hard Test that is made <em>easier</em> becomes a Standard Test.
If both the <em>harder</em> and <em>easier</em> modifiers apply to the
same test (no matter how many times each modifier applies) the
test remains at its original difficulty level.</p>

<h4 id="opposed-tests">Opposed Tests</h4>
<p>GM determines the Target Number for each party.
Both parties then roll d100.
If one party beats the target number but the other does not, that party wins.
Otherwise redo the test until exactly one party has a success.</p>

<p>Note that the target number does not have to be the same for each party;
You can pit the Strength of one character against the Agility of another -
or you can pit one persons Perception against another persons Stealth.</p>

<h4 id="the-01-rule">The 01-rule</h4>
<p>A roll of 01 on the d100 is always a success.
If you roll a 01 in an Opposed Test, you automatically win the test.
If any of your rolls in a Hard Test is a 1, the Hard Test is a success.</p>

<h4 id="the-95-rule">The 95-rule</h4>
<p>No matter how high your skill score is or which circumstantial advantages
you may have, your target number can never be higher than 95.</p>

<h4 id="the-100-rule">The 100-rule</h4>
<p>A roll of 100 on the d100 is always a failure.
If you roll a 100 in an opposed test, you automatically fail the test.
If you roll a 100 on the first roll of an Easy Test, the easy test fails.</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>

<p>There are a number of common terms used in combat:</p>

<h4 id="initiative">Initiative</h4>
<p>Combat is divided into rounds of about 6 seconds in which combatants act in turn.
In the beginning of every combat, each combatant rolls the <em>initiative</em> they use
for the rest of that combat: AGI+1d10.
Each round, each combatant acts in turn in the order of their initiative, from highest to
lowest.</p>

<h4 id="movement">Movement</h4>
<p>The battle scene is divided into squares about a meter on a side.
Combatants move from square to square like chess pieces.
The number of squares you can move depends on your Movement Rate (MR).</p>

<h4 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h4>
<p><em>HP</em> is how many points of damage you can loose before going unconscious.
Your character has STR + TOU + WIL hit points.
You can be damaged by physical attacks against you or by suffering strain
from strenuous activity such as taking Surge Actions or using Powers.
Such damage reduces your current number of HP. If you reach zero HP, you go
<a href="#unconsciousness">unconscious</a>, and  you <a href="#death">die</a> if you reach -30 HP.</p>

<h4 id="defense-points">Defense Points</h4>
<p><em>DP</em> are the number of times per combat (not round) you can try and avoid
non-magical attacks. When an opponent declares that they want to attack you,
but before they actually roll any dice, you can declare that you want to
defend against the attack, making the test <a href="#harder-and-easier"><em>Harder</em></a>.</p>

<p>You can also defend against an attack <em>after</em> an attacker has successfully
struck you, but <em>before</em> they roll for damage.
This costs 3 DP, and it forces the attacker to re-roll their attack test.</p>

<p>You can also defend against an attack after the attacker has rolled damage.
This costs 5 DP, and it forces the attacker to re-roll both attack and damage.</p>

<p>The number of DPs your character has depends on their AGI and the armor they’re wearing.</p>

<p>Take a look at the
<a href="/kaos/rulebook/equipment/#armors">equipment list</a>
for more information about armors.</p>

<h4 id="attack-rolls">Attack Rolls</h4>
<p>To attack someone, you make a skill test to see if you strike the target.
Use the applicable skill: Melee Combat or Ranged Combat for physical attack,
and Witchcraft or Thaumaturgy for magical attacks.</p>

<h4 id="damage-rolls">Damage Rolls</h4>
<p>Having successfully struck an opponent you determine how many Hit Points your opponent
looses by rolling the damage dice applicable for your weapon and adding your Damage Bonus.
If you are making a melee attack, the Damage Bonus is STR÷10.
If you are making a ranged attack, the Damage Bonus is PER÷10.
Magical attacks do not have a Damage Bonus.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/kaos/rulebook/equipment/">equipment list</a>
to find out how much damage your weapon deals.</p>

<h4 id="damage-reduction">Damage Reduction</h4>
<p>If you have Damage Reduction [X] against some type of damage,
you reduce that by X points whenever you suffer such types of damage.
Damage Reduction can never protected against strain damage, such as
the HP drain you suffer when you use powers or take surge actions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have Damage Reduction 20 against fire and you suffer 35 points of fire damage in a single attack,
you reduce that damage to 35-20=15 points. If you suffer 15 points of fire damage or less, you do not
loose a single HP.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="unconsciousness">Unconsciousness</h4>
<p>You loose consciousness if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points or lower.</p>

<h4 id="death">Death</h4>
<p>You die if you are reduced to negative 30 HP.</p>

<h4 id="natural-healing">Natural healing</h4>
<p>Complete rest, such as sitting or lying down, for 1 hour will replenish 10 HP.</p>

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>During each round you can take an »action« such as move, attack, use a power, etc.
This is called your Main Actions.</p>

<h4 id="surge-actions">Surge Actions</h4>
<p>When you have taken your main action you can choose to take one or two Surge Actions.
Surge Actions are just like Main Actions except that they are strenuous.
Taking a surge action drains 1d4 of your HP.
If you are wearing heavy armor, the strain of taking surge actions may be even higher.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/kaos/rulebook/equipment/">equipment list</a>
for more info about additional strain incurred by wearing heavy armor.</p>

<p class="noscreen">Take a look at the equipment list (a separate document) for more information about
strain incurred when wearing heavy armor.</p>

<p>Below is a list of possible actions.</p>

<h4 id="concentrate">Concentrate</h4>
<p>You concentrate on keeping a power (or spell) going until your next turn. You are free to use Surge Actions to take further actions this rund without it interfering with your concentration.</p>

<h4 id="defense-attunement">Defense Attunement</h4>
<p>You regain 2 Defense Points.</p>

<h4 id="drink-a-potion">Drink a potion</h4>
<p>Guess what! You drink a potion.</p>

<h4 id="drop">Drop</h4>
<p>You drop down, going prone.</p>

<h4 id="get-up">Get up</h4>
<p>You rise from a prone position.</p>

<h4 id="load-crossbow">Load crossbow</h4>
<p>You load a crossbow, making it ready to fire.</p>

<h4 id="melee-attack">Melee attack</h4>
<p>Using your Melee Combat skill, you attack your foe with unarmed combat or with a melee weapon.</p>

<h4 id="mountdismount">Mount/dismount</h4>
<p>You mount/dismount your horse (or other riding beast).</p>

<h4 id="move">Move</h4>
<p>You move up to MR squares. Note that wearing certain armors and shields can lower your MR.</p>

<h4 id="ranged-attack">Ranged attack</h4>
<p>Using your Ranged Combat skill, you attack your foe with a missile weapon or a thrown weapon.</p>

<h4 id="stunt">Stunt</h4>
<p>Perform some kind of acrobatic maneuver, possibly requiring an Acrobatics Test. Sometimes this action involves movement. The maximum distance is up to the GM.</p>

<h4 id="switch-weapons">Switch weapons</h4>
<p>You holster/sheathe one weapon and draw/ready another.</p>

<h4 id="use-power">Use Power</h4>
<p>Using the applicable power-skill, you use one of the powers (or cast one of the spells) available to you.</p>

<h2 id="powers">Powers</h2>
<p>Powers are special abilities you can use during the game.
Using powers will drain a number of HP, depending on how
strenuous the power is. There are certain skills that
do nothing except allow you to use powers. These skills
are called Power Skills.
For instance, the Thaumaturgy is a Power Skill; having
a given score in the that skill would grant you the ability
to cast certain Thaumaturgy spells.
Exactly which spells you can cast to depends on the »tier«
of the spell. A tier 1 Thaumaturgy spell requires you to
have a Thaumaturgy score of 15. A Tier 2 spell would require
a skill score of 30, and so on.</p>

<h4 id="battle">Battle</h4>
<p>Use Battle powers.
You cannot use Battle powers if you have not
met the Athletics requirements of any armor you are
wearing.</p>

<h4 id="leadership">Leadership</h4>
<p>Use Leadership powers.</p>

<h4 id="thaumaturgy">Thaumaturgy</h4>
<p>Cast Thaumaturgy spells.
You cannot cast spells if you have not met the
Athletics requirements of any armor you are wearing.
You cannot cast spells when wearing a shield.
If you are wearing armor, you must succeed an Athletics Test
every time you try and cast a spell.</p>

<h4 id="witchcraft">Witchcraft</h4>
<p>Cast Witchcraft spells.
You cannot cast spells if you have not met the
Athletics requirements of any armor you are wearing.
You cannot cast spells when wearing a shield.
If you are wearing armor, you must succeed an Athletics Test
every time you try and cast a spell.</p>

<p>The sum of the scores of your Power Skills may never exceed 90.
In other words, having Leadership 60 and Thaumaturgy 30 would
be OK because their combined score is exactly 90,
but you would never be able to further increase the scores
of your chosen skills, nor would you be able to buy
scores in the Battle or Witchcraft Power Skills.</p>

<h4 id="using-powers">Using powers</h4>
<p>When you use a power you must first make a Standard Test
for the given Power Skill. If the test succeeds, the power
takes effect and you suffer strain.</p>

<h4 id="strain">Strain</h4>
<p>Using powers causes strain damage.
The number of HP drained depends on how strenuous the power is.
The strain occurs <em>after</em> the power has taken effect.
This means that you can successfully use a power and
then fall unconscious by the strain it caused.
Conversely, if you fail to use the power, you do not suffer any
strain damage.</p>

<h4 id="healing">Healing</h4>
<p>You do not regenerate and cannot be healed <em>in any way</em> for an hour after using a power.</p>

<h4 id="tiers">Tiers</h4>
<p>Powers are divided into tiers from 1 to 6. Tier one powers are the easiest
to use and they drain only a 2 HPs per use.
Tier six powers are very difficult to use and drain 12 HPs per use.
Powers have a Skill Score requirements that must be met in order for
the character to be able to use them.</p>

<h4 id="duration">Duration</h4>
<p>Unless specified, all non-instantaneous and non-permanent powers
fade away at the <em>end</em> of your <em>next</em> turn. If you want to keep the power from fading away,
you must take an action next round to Concentrate on that power, which will keep it going for
another round. Outside combat, you can maintain a single power and still do simple tasks such
as walking, talking, etc. People who know you might notice that you are distracted though.</p>

<h4 id="range">Range</h4>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, powers can reach any target within
the caster’s line of sight.</p>

<p>All available powers are listed in the
<a href="/kaos/rulebook/powers/">power list</a></p>

<h2 id="advancement">Advancement</h2>

<p>Characters advance by gaining and spending advancement points (AP).
The GM chooses when APs awards are handed out.
Each player should be awarded around 5 to 20 APs per hour of good roleplaying.</p>

<h4 id="action-bonus">Action, Bonus</h4>
<p>You spend 15 APs and get to do an additional action that round on top of your normal action and surge actions.</p>

<h4 id="escape-evil-destiny">Escape evil destiny</h4>
<p>You spend 50 APs to escape an evil destiny.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You spend 50 APs to barely avoid the rock slide that would have surely killed you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="faster-healing">Faster healing</h4>
<p>You rest for one minute and recover 5 HP per AP spent.</p>

<h4 id="increase-attribute-scores">Increase attribute scores</h4>
<p>You permanently increase an attribute score by 1 point. The AP cost is equal to the new score multiplied by 3. When a attribute score is raised, the derived values (Hit Points, Damage Bonus, unarmored Defense Points, etc.) will be affected as well. The max scores of your skills may increase as well, but the skill scores themselves remain unchanged.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Increasing an attribute from 5 to 6 would cost 6·3=18 APs.</li>
    <li>Increasing an attribute from 20 to 23 would cost 63+66+69=198 APs.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="increase-skill-scores">Increase skill scores</h4>
<p>You permanently increase a skill score by 1 point. The AP cost is equal to the new skill score. You cannot increase a skill score beyond the max-score noted with the given skill.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Increasing a skill from 0 to 1 would cost 1 AP.</li>
    <li>Increasing a skill from 15 to 16 would cost 16 APs.</li>
    <li>Increasing a skill from 20 to 25 would cost 21+22+23+24+25=115 APs.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="lucky-roll">Lucky roll</h4>
<p>You can spend 5 APs to re-roll the last dice you rolled.</p>

<h4 id="power-recovery">Power Recovery</h4>
<p>You spend 20 APs. It is now as if an hour has passed since you last used a power, which means you can be healed again.</p>

<h4 id="power-easy">Power, Easy</h4>
<p>You use a power. If successful, you spend an AP and you only lose half of the HP you would normally lose when using that power.</p>

<h4 id="power-perfect">Power, Perfect</h4>
<p>You use a power. If successful, you spend a number of APs equal to the power tier and you do not lose any HP. Note that you have still used a power and cannot be healed in any way within the next hour.</p>

<h4 id="smooth-surge">Smooth surge</h4>
<p>You spend 3 APs and take a Surge Action without taking any strain damage.</p>
