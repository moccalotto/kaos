# Commune with dead (Ritual): eat the heart of a dead intelligent creature, and temporarily be possessed by its soul. While possessing the magician, the soul is able to communicate with the outside world, and is bound to answer questions truthfully, but not necessarily clearly. Being possessed can be dangerous, and it is recommended that the magician be tied up while possessed, to ensure that the soul does not cause the magician to harm herself.

# Search (Ritual): »Search for person or object«. The magicial takes a bowl of water and places it on a table. They say a few words of command, followed by the name of the person or object and draws a »picture« of him/her/it in the water with a finger. The drawing need not be accurate, it is used to focus the mind of the magician. The magician can now (in the Magical tongue) ask simple queries about the location of the target. The queries must be answerable as yes or no and must only pertain to the location of the target. If the answer is yes, the water will appear to boil. The magician can ask as many questions as they want. The questions may contain references to abstract geographical areas like countries - as long as the magician knows what he means. If the magician does not know the borders of the country they name, the spell might not work. Knowledge:Geography might be a requirement.

#    Is my target on my plane of existence? Yes.
#    Is my target on my continent? Yes.
