    <h3 id="demons">Demons</h3>

<p>When the gods died, most of some of their realms still survived. 
For instance, all the elemental universes survived, as did some of the realms of the dead.
Many of the “hells” collapsed, releasing a lot of demons into the world.
These demons now live in the Ring Mountains. It is said that the demons interbred
with various humanoid species, creating demon half-breeds.</p>

<p>All kinds of demons… all the stuff about how they fell from the now destroyed realms of kaos, etc.
(Zhe nuked the planes of kaos before actually nuking the world)</p>

<p>Heavily inspired by Seven Deadly Sins, demons are extremely powerful. Demon blood can cause mutations and give extreme powers.
Weapons and Armors can be made of demon bits.</p>

<h3 id="wraiths">Wraiths</h3>
<p>How the original cultists of zhe somehow survived and started the Zhe Nation on the plateau of Zhe in the middle of The Great White.
Many types of wraith:</p>

<p><strong>High Priests</strong>:
über powerful psionic power users.</p>

<p><strong>Priests</strong>:
Not defined yet.</p>

<p><strong>Templars</strong>:
Deadly fighters who regenerate. They usually wield two handed swords and have modified toughened skin that serves as armor.</p>

<p><strong>Rogues</strong>:
Fast, stealthy, deadly assassins.</p>

<p><strong>Agents</strong>: Shape shifters / doppelgangers who are able to blend into society. They are even able to talk and produce noise (although they hate it).
agents have limited charm person abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Ghouls</strong>: failed their initiation rite and became almost mindless killing machines.
Ghouls are usually loners whom the Wraiths put out into the Great White.</p>

<h3 id="athryss">Athryss</h3>
<p>The Athryss is a kangaroo-like creature that is extremely susceptible to magical alteration while in its infancy. They can become just about anything.</p>

<p><strong>Cattle</strong>:
 Large cow-like creature with two powerful hind legs and four smaller fron legs. A-Cattle are docile, friendly, and generate a lot of meat. They live up to 20 years.</p>

<p><strong>Ape</strong>:
     * Large, gorilla-like creature with powerful muscles. They have four arms. They can be controlled via Control Animal and are useful for helping with lifting, construction and hard labour. They live up to 6 years.</p>

<p><strong>Monkey</strong>:
Smaller that an Ape, these monkey-like creatures (with four arms) can be controlled to assist in household chores.</p>

<p><strong>Falcon</strong>:
A falcon, great for scouting’n’stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Whale</strong>:
Great at living on the ice,
these large creatures look like killer whales, but have two powerful hind legs, and large tusks like elephants.
They can use these sharp tusks for combat and to dig through the ice.
When the are on top of the ice, the use their legs for propulsion, and slide along their tough bellies.
Whales can be used to pull sleds or even ships. They are also a good source of food on the ice.</p>
