Also known as the “The city of magic”, this city states resides inside the south western part
of Arion, although it is not a part of the Arion alliance.

The city center houses a large number of magical guild houses, magic shops, luxury inns, hotels
and luxury eateries. Housing in the city center consists of apartments for the extremely rich.
Around the city center, you will find markets of mundane goods houses for the rich and apartments
for the upper middle class.
Outside the city proper you will mostly find houses for the lower and lower middle classes
arranged as small (sometimes walled) vilages.

On the periphery of these villages you will find farm houses and a few guard houses and guard towers.

Crime in Taransak is low. Taxes are relatively high. Anything purchased in the city center is taxed
by 20 percent if you are not a resident of the city. Property owners pay property taxes, collected
on a monthly basis. If a property owner falls more than 3 months behind on their property taxes,
the ownership of the property defaults to the city. Any banks or money lenders may petition the city
to recoup some of their losses.

## Relationship with Arion

Taransak has a special relationship with the other city states of Arion; While not part of the alliance,
its magic users have often taken part in the defense of Arion against Tyathia and the Wraith.

Magic users from all over Arion, and even from the rest of Estara come to study in the guilds of
Taransak, which makes Taransak a free city where a lot of diplomatic back channel communication
is conducted between the city states of Arion and the nations outside the alliance.

Formal diplomatic negotiations between Arion and its neighbours is still usually conducted in Arios.
