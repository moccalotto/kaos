The current area now known as Estara is the remnants of the Estaran Continent.
But it is no longer encompassed by oceans, but by impossibly tall mountains,
simply called the Ring Mountains.

The ring mountains are living crystal structures that seem grow continuously.
They are quite steep and range from 5 to 10 km in height.
Above the 2-3 km threshold, the stone/crystal starts to glow, and the glow becomes more intense the higher you go.

This glow is the crystal reacting with the divine essence that surrounds the world, converting their mass to raw magical power.
This process degenerates the crystals, creating an equilibrium such that the mountains remain between 5 and 10km high.

It is practically impossible to tunnel through the mountains because of the hardness and the continual growth of the crystal.
Dwarves have found that tunnelling at least 800 meters below the mountains is possible, but very impractical.

It is said that there are tunnels to the "outside", deep beneath the mountains. Some tunnels lead to the "feywild" - others to a hellish place
Most tunnels lead to an empty wasteland that appears to be empty in all directions -
even though you can see horizon everywhere, some kind of haze makes it impossible to see any objects, persons or buildings further away than 30 meters.

Magic tends to not work correctly in, above and underneath the mountains.
Most types of magic stops working there, while a few simple spells may work, but very erratically.
Magic users risk going mad or dying if trying powerful spells while in the mountains.
