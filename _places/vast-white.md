THe vast white is the largest body of water in Estara. It covers the entire center of the
Estaran continent and is covered in ice that is up to 200 meters thick.

The Vast White itself has a more-or-less constant temperature, but it is extremely cold.

The ice in The Vast White is between 20 and 200 meters thick. Below that is fresh water.

A number of creatures/monsters live on the ice, in the ice, and in the water beneath it.

Magical Fog covers the ground to a height of about 30-40 centimeters.
This fog dissipates in the very center of the ice where visibility is perfect.
Unlike normal fog, this fog seems shiny and radiant and can play tricks on your mind.

The fog affect spells that involce heat and fire;
such spells will temporarily have their tier increased by 1.
