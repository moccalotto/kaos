Arios, the "capital" of Arion, is technically not a real city in the sense that it
did not develop organically by settlers; it was created by all the cities in the
Alliance of Arion to house the Ministers and Masters of Arion so that not one
single city could be said to have more power than the others.

For that reason, Arios itself does not have any kind of voting power
and no masters, ministers or elects hail from Arios. The original, pre-apocalypse, city of
Arios was built on the same principles. Also, the new city of Arios has been built to closely
resemble the original and also resised very close to the original site, only moved a bit to
allow Arios to still have a "harbor" of sorts so that sleds and ice ships can dock there.
Being a harbor city, Arios does have a fair amount of trade has has a strong economy.
The taxes in Arios are very low; goods exported out of the city are taxed by around
5 percent and ad hoc lodgings (i.e. rooms at inns and hotels) are taxed at 10 percent.
Aside from that, the city puts a small tax on the use of the harbor, the rail roads and
the city stables.
