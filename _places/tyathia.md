a slave on a slave market.
Tyathia also have fighting rings รก la old rome.

It was originally the armies of Tyathia that invaded Arion and laid claim to its land
and its people on behalf of the Estaran Empire.

Tyathian magic users strive to enslave or otherwise harness demons.

Sometimes the experiments go wrong, creating horrible and uncontrollable abominations.
