### Demons

All kinds of demons... all the stuff about how they fell from the now destroyed realms of kaos, etc.
(Zhe nuked the planes of kaos before actually nuking the world)

Heavily inspired by Seven Deadly Sins, demons are extremely powerful. Demon blood can cause mutations and give extreme powers.
Weapons and Armors can be made of demon bits.


### Wraiths
How the original cultists of zhe somehow survived and started the Zhe Nation on the plateau of Zhe in the middle of The Great White.
Many types of wraith:


**High Priests**:
Ã¼ber powerful psionic power users.

**Priests**:
Not defined yet.

**Templars**:
Deadly fighters who regenerate. They usually wield two handed swords and have modified toughened skin that serves as armor.

**Rogues**:
Fast, stealthy, deadly assassins.

**Agents**: Shape shifters / doppelgangers who are able to blend into society. They are even able to talk and produce noise (although they hate it).
agents have limited charm person abilities.

**Ghouls**: failed their initiation rite and became almost mindless killing machines.
Ghouls are usually loners whom the Wraiths put out into the Great White.
