<p>
    <strong>Base</strong>: The score that all characters get for free.
    During character creation players can increase their scores by spending
    Skill Points, one Skill Point per skill score increase.
    Later on they they can spend Advancement Points to increase their skills.
    The AP cost of advancing a skill score by 1 is the same as the new Skill Score.
    <blockquote>
        <ul>
            <li>Increasing a skill from 0 to 1 would cost 1 AP.</li>
            <li>Increasing a skill from 15 to 16 would cost 16 APs.</li>
            <li>Increasing a skill from 20 to 25 would cost 21+22+23+24+25=115 APs.</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <strong>Max</strong>: The character cannot advance their Skill Score beyond the Max Score in any way.
