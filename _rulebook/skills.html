<p>
    <strong>Base</strong>: The base score that all characters get for free
    during character creation. To improve their character further before
    game beings, they can spend skill points at a one-to-one rate to improve skills.
    After that, they can purchase skill upgrades via Advancement Points.
</p>

<p>
    Note that, should the character's attribute scores increase, the character's
    skill scores do NOT increase with it; the base score is only used during
    character creation.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Max</strong>: The character cannot advance their Skill Score
    higher than the max score. To increase this ceiling,
    the player must spend Advancement Points to improve their attribute scores.
