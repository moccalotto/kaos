To find out if an action succeeds, we roll 1d100 versus a given *target number*.
If the result of this *test* comes up lower-than or equal to that target number,
it means that we have achieved some kind of success.
If the result is higher than the target number, we have failed the test.

**Standard Tests**: Roll 1d100 vs. the target number.
A target number can be a skill score, an attribute score, or something entirely different.

**Hard Tests**: You roll 1d100 twice.
You succeed if both rolls are below or equal to the target number.

**Easy Tests**: You role 1d100 twice.
You succeed if one of the rolls is below or equal to the target number.

**Opposed Tests**: GM determines the Target Number for each party. Both parties then roll.
If exactly one party has a success, that party wins.
Otherwise redo the test ontil exactly one party has a success.

**The 1-rule**: A roll of 1 on the d100 is always a success.
However, note that you cannot even attempt to use skills in which
you have a score of 0, so the 1-rule would not apply.

**The 95-rule**: No matter how high your skill score is or which circumstantial
advantagas you have, any roll of 96-100 is always a failure.

## Combat

There are a number of common terms used in combat:

**Initiative**: Combat is divided into rounds in which each combatant take one action.
In the beginning of every combat, each combatant rolls the *initiative* that they use for the
rest of that combat: 1d10 + (AGI / 10).
Each round, combatants act in order of their initiative, highest to lowest.

**Movement**: The battle scene is divided into squares, 1.5 meters on a side.
Combatants move from square to square like chess pieces.
The number of squares you can move in a round depends
on the action you take and your Movement Rate (MR).

**Hit Points** (HP): These points represents the number of points of damage you can take before
going unconsious. All characters have STR + TOU + WIL hit points.

**Attack rolls**: To attack someone, you first make a skill test to see if strike the target.
Use the applicable skill: Melee Combat or Ranged Combat for physical attack,
or Witchcraft or Thaumaturgy for magical attacks.

**Defense rolls**: Having been struck, you make a defense roll against your Defense Score.
If you are using armor, your DS is equal to the DS of the armor.
If you are not wearing armor, your DS is equal to your AGI.
Using a shield will increase your Defense score, no matter if you are wearing armor or not.
If your defense roll succeeds, you dodge or block the attack, and suffer no damage.

**Damage rolls**: Having struck an opponent who failed their Defense Roll,
you roll the dice listed for your weapon and add STR / 10. Your opponent loose that many Hit Points.

**Damage Reduction**: If you have Damage Reduction (x) against the type of damage you are about to suffer,
you reduce the amount by x points.

> If you have Damage Reduction 20 against fire, and you suffer 35 points of fire damage,
> you reduce that damage to 35-20=15 points.

**Unconsciousness and death**: You loose consciousness if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points or lower.
You die if you are reduced to negative number that equals your STR+TOU.

**Natural healing**:
Complete rest, such as sitting or lying down, for 1 hour will replenish TOU Hit Points.
Magic users cannot heal naturally if they have cast a spell within the last hour.

### Actions

## Advancement

Characters advance by gaining and advancement points (AP)
that can be used to »buy« advancements.
APs are usually given at the end of sessions.
As a rule of thumb, each character should be awarded 10 to 20 APs per hour of good roleplaying.
There various ways APs can be spent are described below:

**Increasing skill scores**:
The AP cost of increasing a skill score by 1 is equal to the current skill score.
You cannot increase a skill score beyond the max-score noted with the given skill.

**Increasing attribute scores**:
The AP cost of increasing a primary attribute score by 1 is equal to the
current attribute score multiplied by 3.
When a attribute score is raised, the derived values
(Hit Points, damage bonus, unarmored Defense Score, etc.)
may be affected as well.
Skill scores are not affected when attribute scores are increased, but the various max-scores are.

**Making lucky rerolls**:
You can spend 10 APs to reroll the last dice you rolled.
You can only do this once per roll.

**Making rolls easier**:
Before you roll, you can spend 5 APs turning a standard test into an easy test
or turning a hard test into an easy test.

**Faster healing**: You rest for one minute and

**Escaping evil destinies**: You spend 50 APs to escape an evil destiny.

**Super parry**: You spend 2 AP to use your Melee Combat as
your Defense Score to avoid a single attack.

## Magic
There are two types of magic: thaumaturgy and witchcraft,
each have an applicable skill that the magic user must know in order to cast them.

A magic user cannot cast spells while wearing armor, using a shield or wearing extreme cold weather gear.

Casting spells drain a number of hit points from the magic user. The number of HP drained
depends on the power of the spell.

Magic users cannot be healed (naturally, magically or otherwise) if they have cast any spells
withing the last hour.

Spells have a Skill Score requirements that must be met in order to or cast them.
A magic user that does not meet these requirements can still cast these spells, but the HP drain is quadrupled.

A magic user can specialize in a number of spells equal to their applicable Skill Score / 10.
Casting a spell that you are specialized in only requires half the normal amount of HP.
A magic user can only specialize in a spell if they meet the Skill Score requirements.

Unless otherwise specified, spells affect a single target (the subject)
within 10 squares that is visible to the caster.
