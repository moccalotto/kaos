**Omnicasting**:
A magic user that does not meet the skill score requirements
can still cast the given spell, but the HP drain is quadrupled.

**Spell Specialization**:
A cast can also specialize in a number of spells equal to the applicable skill score divided by 10.
Casting a spell that you are specialized in only requires half the normal amount of HP.
