This section describes how to create a character.
Before you start, make sure you have read this section
in its entirety.

Also get/make a character sheet on which to write your scores, choices,
skills, etc.

### Attributes
There are six attributes that quantify a KAOS character:

**Strength** (STR),
**Agility** (AGI),
**Toughness** (TOU),
**Perception** (PER),
**Willpower** (WIL),
and **Charisma** (CHA).

Distribute 100 points amongst these six primary attributes.
No attribute can be higher than 30 or lower than 5.

## Race
Having chosen your attributes, the second thing to choose is your race.
At this stage, it is important that you have read about skills and equipment,
so that you know about the terms *Skill Points* and *Equipment Points*.
You can see more about races in the races

## Skills
Skills have a *base score* and a *max score* that depend on the attribute scores of the character.
All characters start with *base score* in all their skills.
In addition to that, they get a number of *skill points* to increase
their skill scores.
Skill can ever have a score higher than its *max score*.

> The *Acrobatics* skill has a base score of STR รท 2 and a max score of STR + TOU.
> A character with STR 21 and TOU 15 would have a base score of 21รท2=10 in *Acrobatics*,
> and would be able to increase that skill to 21+15=36 by spending 26 skill points.

The two types of magic, Thaumaturgy and Witchcraft, are very different in their philosophical outlook.
Characters *can* learn both skills, but the sum of the two skill scores cannot exceed 90.

In order to learn Thaumaturgy, a character must have a PER of at least 20.
In order to learn Witchcraft, a character must have a WIL of at least 20.

## Languages
All characters can speak their native language.
In addition to that, characters get a number of extra languages,
equal to their *Languages* skill score divided by 10.

Characters can read and write a number of languages equal to
their *Literacy* score divided by 10.

## Equipment
Depending on the race your chose, you have a number of initial
gold pieces (GP) with which to buy starting equipment.
