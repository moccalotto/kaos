    <h1 id="premise">Premise</h1>

<p>The world consists on a single enormous city and a never-ending, living dungeon
underneath it.</p>

<p>While this setting would obviously work in a fantasy or high fantasy campaign,
it could easily be adapted for other styles such as modern, futuristic,
cyberpunk, steampunk, superhero, etc. In settings without magic, you can simply
replace magic with technology. In steampunk, a combination of tech and alchemy
can replace magic.</p>

<h2 id="the-city">The City</h2>

<p>The city is enormous. Most citizens live in very tall buildings, and the more
rich and powerful of course live in the top floors.</p>

<p>There are “top streets” at the higher levels, arranged so the wealthy can
traverse the city without having to go down to street level.</p>

<p>Magic is used to assist in the creation of the tall buildings and, their
foundations and the elevators and support structures.</p>

<p>A tall wall surrounds the city to keep the hostile Outside at bay.</p>

<p>The city can be expanded by so-called land-shards. These rare artifacts are
sometimes found in The Dungeon. A land-shard is a magical device that can drive
away the Outside and expose an area of raw bedrock. The city workers then have
a very short amount of time to construct a temporary bulwark against the
outside. After that, a more permanent wall can be constructed.</p>

<h3 id="the-pit-the-entrance-to-the-dungeon-almost-400-meter-deep-cone-shaped-hole">The Pit The entrance to the dungeon. Almost 400 meter deep cone shaped hole</h3>
<p>with extremely steep sides. At the bottom is a village called Pit City where
the tough guys hang out. Along the way down are various “holes” (entrances to
The Dungeon). In order to get down or up, one must use a series of elevators.
In order to access most entrances, one must take other elevators and/or do some
climbing.</p>

<h3 id="pit-city">Pit City</h3>

<p>Pit City is a tent village that is the main staging area for entering The
Dungeon.  There is an inn, a weaponsmith, a few general stores and a basic
mage-supply store. Other than that, there are some public latrines and an area
for tents. Put City is sometimes attacked by Dungeon Denizens, however, such
attacks are almost always repelled by the Pit Citizens. For this reason, the
land in Pit City is not taxed in any way. The owner of the inn serves as the de
facto mayor of Pit City.</p>

<h3 id="the-bedrock">The Bedrock</h3>

<p>The bedrock on which the city stands is an extremely hard crystalline material.
It requires the highest level of magic to pierce it. Furthermore the bedrock
seems to be organic in some way and it regenerates any damage done to it within
a few days.</p>

<p>A few of the attempts to massively dig down has resulted in exposing the city
directly to very dangerous areas of The Dungeon.</p>

<p>There seems to be no clear correlation between where you dig down and which
area of The Dungeon is exposed.</p>

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>

<p>The city has almost no resources. There is no mining due to the special nature
of the bedrock. Farming can only be undertaken with dirt collected in The
Dungeon, combined with manure reasons</p>

<p>Adventurers have to go into The Dungeon to find or harvest food for the
citizens.</p>

<h4 id="food">Food</h4>

<p>The vast majority of food comes from The Dungeon. Meats from various monsters
is highly valued. Fungi can be harvested from certain areas in The Dungeon and
are also highly valued. The citizens are able to grow certain crops on roof
tops and balconies (if they get enough light). Many citizens also grow their
own spices inside their houses. However, many spices can be obtained in The
Dungeon as it turns out that certain monster parts are themselves quite spicy
and tasty. Certain molds are also very tasty, and sometimes adventurers will
find special nutritional plants in The Dungeon that are both high in nutrients
and taste. Some plants can even be used in baking.</p>

<p>Salt can be found in The Dungeon in areas where the bedrock gives way to
mundane rock and allow water to deposit minerals.</p>

<p>To really vary the types, variety and quality of food, citizens rely heavily on
magic. Many mages can make a decent living simply by spicing up, and even
transmuting the food that is gathered in The Dungeon.</p>

<p>Monsters often posses foods that are not normally found in The Dungeon. For
instance, some tribes of dark elves, cave giants, and orcs sometimes possess
cheeses, baked goods, veal-like meats, and even alcoholic beverages. It is a
great source of mystery how these tribes obtain such riches.</p>

<h4 id="water">Water</h4>

<p>The Dungeon is home to many lakes and streams. The main trouble is that these
often serve as watering holes for a number of monsters. Some caves and caverns
have water dripping from the ceilings or slowly condensing on the walls. Some
spelunkers make a living by collecting that water. Even though it is a slow
process, it is relatively safe and it only requires a few simple containers.</p>

<p>Magic and alchemy can be used to purify water and even distil water from blood
and other fluids.</p>

<h4 id="metal">Metal</h4>

<p>The Dungeon is the only source of metal available. For some reason, many
monsters carry weapons and other gear containing metal. Where they get it is a
mystery as no adventurers have ever found any mines in The Dungeon.</p>

<p>Certain monsters have metal-like hides, bones and teeth. These are very
valuable. Additionally, magic can be used to transmute bone and certain monster
scales, claws, and bones into metal, but these methods are quite time consuming
and expensive.</p>

<p>Sometimes metals can be mined from certain areas of The Dungeon, but this is
very dangerous and will require adventurers as guards. Also such mines are
always temporary because of the shifts the dungeon undergoes.</p>

<h4 id="stone">Stone</h4>

<p>As with metal, stone can be mined from certain areas of The Dungeon. Some
monsters also carry stone. Certain monster parts can be transmuted into stone
by magic.</p>

<h4 id="wood">Wood</h4>

<p>As with metal, the only real source of wood for making tools and for burning
comes from The Dungeon. Some monsters have wooden tools and weapons from which
the woods can be salvaged. On rare occasions “wooden” monsters such as treants
can be encountered. Such monsters are highly valuable.</p>

<p>As with metal, magic is heavily used to create wood from bone.</p>

<h4 id="fuel">Fuel</h4>

<p>Most wood found in The Dungeon is used to craft items, furniture, etc. Certain
inedible monster parts are sometimes dried out and turned into “charcoal” to be
used as fuel. Also a number of monsters have fat, blubber, and oil deposits
that can be used as fuel.</p>

<p>Some other-worldly monsters such as fire elementals and salamanders can be
harnessed as sources of heat.</p>

<p>As with wood and metal, some intelligent monsters carry fuel sources such as
oil, coal and charcoal.</p>

<h3 id="taxes">Taxes</h3>

<p>The tax system is quite simple; there is none. However, all land must be leased
from the city government. The price of leasing a building varies greatly
depending on the price, location and condition of the building. The price also
varies depending on the purpose the lease. For instance, leasing a building
with the purpose of common housing is cheaper than leasing it to be used as a
public house - at least in certain areas. The city council can designate an
area to be used for a given purpose. If you lease a property to be used for
anything other than that purpose, your lease will be higher.  The leaseholder
can get a rebate if she refurbishes the building. The city may also provide
some financing for such purposes.</p>

<p>The most expensive type of lease is the type where you lease a building for
with the only purpose of living in it yourself.</p>

<p>The city also have other sources of revenue such as the cranes that transport
people and goods to/from The Dungeon.</p>

<p>The city also imposes a 1 percent tax on guild incomes.</p>

<h3 id="the-people">The People</h3>

<h4 id="spelunkers">Spelunkers</h4>

<p>Spelunkers make a living in The Dungeon in some way. This may be as miners,
guides, explorers, or just old school adventurers. Spelunking is the primary
sector of the economy. Spelunkers have a strange position in society. They are
seen as both valiant heroes and dirty workers at the same time. And since the
average life span of spelunkers is very short, they usually have trouble
finding spouses. However, veteran spelunkers often have a chance at reaching
good societal standings.</p>

<h4 id="nobility">Nobility</h4>

<p>creating and purifying water, and other societal goods.</p>

<h4 id="importers">Importers</h4>

<p>Importers are a special kind of merchant that trade directly with spelunkers to
purchase the products and materials from The Dungeon. Importers then sell on
such products to the crafters of the city. The Importers Guild often commission
the finding of certain materials. Some crafters are also importers. However
this means that the crafter will have to pay for memberships in both their
crafting guild and the Importers Guild.</p>

<h4 id="crafters-a-crafter-or-craftsman-is-a-person-that-is-engaged-in-the">Crafters A crafter or craftsman is a person that is engaged in the</h4>
<p>industries of the city.  Craftsmen often trade directly with spelunkers to
purchase</p>

<h4 id="templars-guild">Templars Guild</h4>

<h4 id="crafters-guild">Crafters Guild</h4>

<h3 id="variant-conflicted-city">Variant: Conflicted City</h3>

<p>The city is riddled with conflict, corruption, politics and drama. Guilds
constantly compete for power and resources.  It is usually the adventurers that
suffer when the rich and powerful citizens compete against each other.  For
instance, adventurers have to <em>pay</em> to get/accept quests. Only if they return
will they get their deposit back as well as the reward.</p>

<p>If adventurers bring loot up top that is not directly sanctioned via a quest,
it is heavily taxed. Adventurers risk having their possessions taxed more than
once if they do not have the correct paper work (when you enter The Dungeon you
get a receipt of your equipment, and anything you bring back other than the
stated equipment is taxed. You do not get a rebate in case of lost or expended
equipment).</p>

<h2 id="the-dungeon">The Dungeon</h2>

<p>The Dungeon is a bit like the city in Blame!</p>

<h3 id="why-do-monsters-have-metal-wood-food-and-fuel-">Why do monsters have metal, wood, food and fuel ?</h3>

<h2 id="beyond-the-city">Beyond The City</h2>

<h3 id="variant-the-forest">Variant: The Forest</h3>

<p>Outside The City is an enormous forest that is very Fangorn-like. All the trees
are sentient and will attack any adventurer that actively harms the forest.
Certain adventurers go into the forest to forage for fallen trees and recently
dead animals. The adventurers seem to sometimes be allowed to defend themselves
from animal attacks. However this is not always the case so many adventurers
run away from hostile animals if possible.</p>
