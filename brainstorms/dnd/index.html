    <h1 id="moon-druid">Moon Druid</h1>
<p>Close combat build with buff and healing spells</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am a
    <ul>
      <li>Gnome</li>
      <li>Halfling</li>
      <li>Dwarf</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I have a bit of green-skin blood in my ancestry.</li>
  <li>This has caused me to be exiled by my clan.</li>
  <li>I have found that nature provides.</li>
  <li>But lately I have also come to see that civilization
has some awesome things to offer. For instance
entertainment and alcohol.</li>
  <li>As a result, I have become quite overweight.</li>
  <li>I find adventuring quite fascinating, and I do it
more for the entertainment than the money.</li>
  <li>I do not save up money - I spend it on the 
splendors the city can provide.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="paladin-oath-of-vengeance">Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)</h1>
<p>Angsty, gritty paladin:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am a Tiefling.</li>
  <li>I hate my infernal background.</li>
  <li>I am in constant turmoil with myself.</li>
  <li>I feel a secret shame when I have to resort to 
using my fiendish abilities.</li>
  <li>I want to take vengeance on any fiend who
roams the land.</li>
  <li>Before being taken in by “the monastery”,
I was a very bad boy indeed. Because of the 
burden of my fiendish background, I resorted 
to drinking, mischief, causing trouble,
adultery, sometimes even fighting.</li>
  <li>I now feel that I have found the right path,
and I try to combat my infernal instincts as
much as possible.</li>
  <li>Whenever I “fall of the wagon” and give in
to temptation, I feel deeply ashamed and I 
feel I must atone - generally causing my 
mood to be sour until I get to fulfil that
atonement (refer to the Oath of Vengeance).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="warlock-pact-of-the-blade-the-fiend">Warlock (Pact of the Blade, The Fiend)</h1>
<p>Close combat build with focus on con.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am a Hill Dwarf.</li>
  <li>I was shunned by my peers for being physically inept when
I was very young.</li>
  <li>My biggest wish was to one day be great at wielding a weapon,
so I could show my childhood bullies.</li>
  <li>I got my wish.</li>
  <li>My fiend lord granted me physical strength, a magical weapon,
and a other powerful magical abilities.</li>
  <li>I soon used these abilities to cause terror among my 
childhood bullies.</li>
  <li>After that, I was exiled.</li>
  <li>I have now realized that I have made en eternal pact with a
monster; that every time I kill with magic or my blade, the
victims soul is eaten by my lord. This weighs upon me.</li>
  <li>I try and keep up a good natured facade.</li>
  <li>I try to do good to compensate for the pact I made.</li>
  <li>I try to only kill monsters with my magic.</li>
  <li>I might end up drinking a bit too much as a kind of self-
medication.</li>
  <li>Secretly I still want the powers granted me by my lord;
I do not want to do its bidding, but I want the power.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="sorcerer-wild-magic">Sorcerer (Wild Magic)</h1>
<p>Funny, adorable, but powerful spell caster.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am a
    <ul>
      <li>Halfling that was raised by goblins and have 
studied their shamanic ways.</li>
      <li>Gnome with a crazy Einstein thing going on.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I have lots of personality.</li>
  <li>I have a ton of fun.</li>
  <li>I go adventuring because it is interesting,
not because it is profitable.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1 id="warlock-pact-of-the-of-the-tome-the-great-old-one">Warlock (Pact of the of the Tome, The Great Old One)</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I am a Rock Gnome.</li>
  <li>I am clever.</li>
  <li>I am eccentric.</li>
  <li>I might have a touch of ADHD.</li>
  <li>I probably also have som mild autism.</li>
  <li>I don’t like getting dirty.</li>
  <li>I don’t like disorder and disorderly surroundings.</li>
  <li>In spite of my high CHA, I suck at dealing with 
people in everyday conversation.
I <em>can</em> do it, but if I do not make the effort
and “pretend I care”, my cold logic will often
make me seem like a total douche.</li>
  <li>I don’t really see the harm in allying 
with a great old one. Especially because I
use that alliance to do good.</li>
  <li>I’m more curious than frightened of my patron.</li>
  <li>I often think of myself as being more intelligent
and cunning than my patron.</li>
  <li>I am intrigued to find out what my patron actually is,
what its end-goals are, and how I might outsmart it.</li>
</ul>
