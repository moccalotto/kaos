## Elects

Once every 8<sup>th</sup> year, any town of 50 or more adult persons must choose a candidate elect.
Larger cities must choose more than one candidates.
The number to choose is based on a logarithm of the number of adult citizens.
For every candidate picked, the towns may also pick one secondary candidate.
This candidate can be used if the primary candidate is deemed unsuited to become an elect.

As soon as they have been chosen, primary and secondary candidates travel Arioss to be tested and judged by the Councel of Masters.
The types of tests a candidates undergo is unique to each candidate.
Most candidates are evaluated on ideological, philosophical and psychological grounds,
but some also need to prove themselves physically. The tests can last anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks.

The Council of Masters judge whether a candidate is suited as an elect or not, and they also judge which type of Elect the candidate is most suited for.

When the candidate has become an Elect, he/she travels around Arion for at least 10 years, doing his/her duty and serving the Codex of Arion.

It is customary for the Elects to visit the home town of the Master that "approved" them.

Elects are to be given shelter provisions as needed by the townships they serve. Elects are honor bound to not exploit the hospitality and resources of the townships.
Elects must keep journals with daily updates. Updates while traveling need not be detailed, but updates while staying in townships must be detailed about where (as in which building) the Elect stayed and for how long, and what they were given to eat.

Every year, the elect must travel to Arioss to hand in his/her personal journal, and to get a new one. The journals have magical properties.

When an elect has served the Codex of Arion for at least 10 years, he/she can apply for a promotion to either Minister or Master. The Elect can apply once every year.
