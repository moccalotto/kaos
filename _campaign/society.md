## Arion

Arion is an alliance of free city states. All citizens of the Arion alliance are free;
there are no slaves, bondsmen, indentured servants or similar.

All cities within the alliance must adhere to the Code of Arion, which generally states
all intelligent life is free and must never be enslaved, endentured or bonded.
It also has rules and guidelines for taxation, imprisonment, exhile and even capital punishment.
But mostly the Code of Arion focuses on the Elects, their function and what they represent.

### Elects

Once every 3000 days (on a day called the Day of Choosing), any town of at least 50 adult
persons must choose a candidate elect.
Cities with at least 500 citizens must choose 2 elects,
cities with at least 5000 citizens must choose 3 elects and so on.
For every candidate chosen, the towns may also choose one secondary candidate.
This candidate can be used if the primary candidate is deemed unsuited to become an elect.

Each town or city in the alliance has its very own day of choosing such that there is always
a steady stream of new candidate elects.

As soon as they have been chosen, primary and secondary candidates travel Arios to be tested
and judged by the Councel of Masters.
The types of tests a candidates undergo is unique to each candidate.
Most candidates are evaluated on ideological, philosophical and psychological grounds,
but some also need to prove themselves physically. The tests can last anywhere from a few hours to
a few weeks. The tests are not necessarily fair or even. However, if a set of masters make unreasonable
requests of a candidate elect, the Council of Ministers can veto the test and make the masters come
up with a new test for the candidate.

The Council of Masters judge whether a candidate is suited as an elect or not,
and they also judge which type of Elect the candidate is most suited for.

When the candidate has become an Elect, he/she travels around Arion for
at least 10 years, doing their duty and serving the Code of Arion.

It is customary for the Elects to visit the home town of the Master that "approved" them within
the first year after being approved.

Elects are to be given shelter provisions as needed by the townships they serve.
Elects are honor bound to not exploit the hospitality and resources of the townships.
Elects must keep journals with daily updates.
While traveling, such updates need not be detailed, but updates while staying in townships
must be detailed about where (as in which building) the Elect stayed and for how long,
and what they were given to eat. Of course the journal must also contain detailed descriptions
of the elects activities while in the township.

Every year, the elect must travel to Arios to hand in his/her personal journal, and to get a new one.
The journals have magical properties - they will not easily burn, freeze, rot, get wet, etc.
Moreover, whatever is entered into it cannot be erased by any non magical means.

When an elect has served the Code of Arion for at least 10 years,
he/she can apply for a promotion to either Minister or Master.
The Elect can apply once every year.
