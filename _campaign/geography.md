The campaign takes place in an area that was formerly known as the Estaran Continent;
an ancient empire that spanned an entire continent from coast to coast.

This continent was home to a single vast empire called the Estaran Empire;
a somewhat degenerate theocracy where the priests of elder god Zhe ruled the
vassal countries with iron fists.

Centuries ago, Zhe attempted to destroy the entire world, devouring the sun
and the moons and hammering its giant fist into the center of the Estaran Continent,
where the grandest temple of Zhe was located.

The entire world shattered in an event simply known as "Zhe's Apocalypse" in later times.

However, all was not completely lost; Zhe's offspring, the lesser gods,
sacrificed themselves to save the remnants of the world.
They bled their celestial blood onto the world in an effort to save some of it and the life thereon.


## Ring Mountains

The current area now known as Estara is the remnants of the Estaran Continent.
But it is no longer encompassed by oceans, but by impossibly tall mountains,
simply called the Ring Mountains.

The ring mountains are living crystal structures that seem grow continuously.
They are quite steep and range from 5 to 10 km in height.
Above the 2-3 km threshold, the stone/crystal starts to glow, and the glow becomes more intense the higher you go.

This glow is the crystal reacting with the divine essence that surrounds the world, converting their mass to raw magical power.
This process degenerates the crystals, creating an equilibrium such that the mountains remain between 5 and 10km high.

It is impossible to tunnel through the mountains because of the hardness and the continual growth of the crystal.
Dwarves have found that tunnelling at least 800 meters below the mountains is possible, but very impractical.

It is said that there are tunnels to the "outside", deep beneath the mountains. Some tunnels lead to the "feywild" - others to a hellish place
Most tunnels lead to an empty wasteland that appears to be empty in all directions -
even though you can see horizon everywhere, some kind of haze makes it impossible to see any objects, persons or buildings further away than 30 meters.

Magic tends to not work correctly in, above and underneath the mountains.
Most types of magic stops working there, while a few simple spells may work, but very erratically.
Magic users risk going mad or dying if trying powerful spells while in the mountains.


## Vast White

The Vast White itself has a more-or-less constant temperature, but it is extremely cold.

The ice in The Vast White is between 20 and 200 meters thick. Below that is fresh water.

A number of creatures/monsters live on the ice, in the ice, and in the water beneath it.

Magical Fog covers the ground to a height of about 30-40 centimeters.
This fog dissipates in the very center of the ice where visibility is perfect.
Unlike normal fog, this fog seems shiny and radiant and can play tricks on your mind.

The fog and the cold affect spells that involce heat and fire;
such spells will temporarily have their tier increased by 1.

* Fauna and flora (yes, flora) on the ice.
* How to fish in the Vast Ocean


## Arion
Arion was a new, and thus unwilling, addition to the Estarian empire.
Many of its people were taken as slaves to serve in mines in the far south-east or as
labor in the construction of temples to Zhe in the region.

After the apocalypse, Arion has gone back to its former mode of rule and government, which is
an aliance of independent city states.

### Arios
Arios, the "capital" of Arion, is technically not a real city in the sense that it
did not develop organically by settlers; it was created by all the cities in the
Alliance of Arion to house the Ministers and Masters of Arion so that not one
single city could be said to have more power than the others.

For that reason, Arios itself does not have any kind of voting power
and no masters, ministers or elects hail from Arios. The original, pre-apocalypse, city of
Arios was built on the same principles. Also, the new city of Arios has been built to closely
resemble the original and also resised very close to the original site, only moved a bit to
allow Arios to still have a "harbor" of sorts so that sleads and ice ships can dock there.
Being a harbor city, Arios does have a fair amount of trade has has a strong economy.
The taxes in Arios are very low; goods exported out of the city are taxed by around
5 percent and ad-hoc lodgings (i.e. rooms at inns and hotels) are taxed at 10 percent.
Aside from that, the city puts a small tax on the use of the harbor, the rail roads and
the city stables.

## The Plains
Southern neighbour Arion.
This was possibly the most unruly and diversely populated region of Estara.
The population of the plains was heavily culled for slave labour in the pre-apocaypse days.
The Plains are now populated by tribal communities รก la "village states".
The tribal leaders have close communications with each other and all strive for unity
to be able to combat any invasion by the Wraith or even by Tyathia.
The Tribes of The Plains have adopted a code very similar to The Code of Arion to be able
to The tribes of The Plains are closely allied with Arion because they see Arion as a
buffer between them and Tyathia.
Even so, Tyathia has previously launched a naval army to try and capture certain
areas of The Plains - however, a united front of warriors from the tribes
repelled the invasion with the aid of weaponry and battle equipment purchased and
loaned from Arion.
