## Ring Mountains
The ring mountains are living crystal structures that grow continuously.
They are quite steep and range from 5 to 10 km in height.
Above the 2-3 km threshold, the stone/crystal starts to glow, and the glow becomes more intense the higher you go. 

This glow is the crystal reacting with the divine essence that surrounds the world, converting their mass to raw magical power.
This process degenerate the crystals, and this equilibrium exists such that the mountains remain between 5 and 10km.

It is impossible to tunnel through the mountains because of the hardness and the continual growth.
Dwarves have found that tunnelling at least 800 meters below the mountains is possible, but very impractical. 

It is said that there are tunnels to the "outside", deep beneath the mountains. Some tunnels lead to the "feywild" - others to a hellish place
Most tunnels lead to an empty wasteland that appears to be empty in all directions -
even though you can see horizon everywhere, some kind of haze makes it impossible to see any objects, persons or buildings further away than 30 meters.


Magic tends to not work correctly in, above and underneath the mountains.
Most types of magic stops working, while a few simple spells may work, but very erratically.
Magic users risk going mad or dying if trying powerful spells while in the mountains.


## Vast White
The Vast White itself has a more-or-less constant temperature, but it is extremely cold.

The ice in The Vast White is about 20 meters thick. Below that is fresh water.

A number of creatures/monsters life on the ice, in the ice, and in the water

Magical Fog covers the ground to a height of about 30-40 centimeters. The nearer to land you get, the higher the fog.

Fire spells on The Vast White have their potency diminished because of the temperature and the fog.

## Estara
The entire area encircled by the Ring Mountains used to be a single empire called Estara.
The countries in estara were all governed by the High Priests of Zhestaria (The Temple of Zhe), 
locatec roughly in the middle of the empire.

Some of the countries in the Estarian empire were there wilingly and prospered. Others were ruled with an iron fist.

## Arion
Arion was a new, and thus unwilling, addition to the Estarian empire.
Many of its native peoples were taken as slaves to serve in mines or as
labor in the construction of temples to Zhe in the region.

Etc. etc.

After the apocalypse, Arion has gone back to its former mode of rule and government, which is 
a kind of republic.


## Tyathia
Neighboar to the east of Arion.
A former prosperous member of Estara, they keep the traditions alive. They have a cast system. 
The lowest cast are called untouchables. These essentialy serve as slaves.
If you are a prisoner of war or a criminal in Tyathia, the local government will sell you as 
a slave on a slave market.
Tyathia also have fighting rings รก la old rome.


## The Plains
Southern neighbour Arion.
This was possibly the most unruly and diversely populated region of Estara.
The Plains were heavily robbed of slaves in the pre-apocalyptic days.
The Plains are now populated by tribal communities รก la city states, but much smaller.
The tribal leaders have close communications with each other and all strive for unity
to be able to combat any invasion by the Wraith or even by Tyathia.
The tribes of The Plains are closely allied with Arion because they see Arion as a
buffer between them and Tyathia.
Even so, Tyathia has previously launched a naval army to try and capture certain
areas of The Plains - however, a united from of warriors from the tribes, aided 
with weaponry and battle equipment from Arion, repelled the attack.


## Other Worlds
Flying over the mouintains lead to a "cloud world" where a number of populated "asteroids" float around like islands in a sea of glowing mist.
The asteroid-worlds are flat on top and cone shaped underneath.
Often populated, each asteroid is tiny world with their own culture and sometimes unique races.
In the cloud-world, air balloon travel is quite common, as the winds are mild and it enables relatively safe travel from island to island.
WORLD is itself such a world - it is the biggest of them all - and it is the only one with ring mountains and an permanent aura of raw magical power.

One can only fly over the rim mountains by non-magical means - riding dragons, flying hot air balloons or using zeppelins.
Hot air ballons can be powered by elementals - however - they must not be summoned - they must be portalled into WORLD and be here willingly.
