The campaign takes place in an area that was formerly known as the Estaran Empire;
an ancient empire that spanned an entire continent, known as the Estaran Continent.

Centuries ago, Zhe, the elder god, grew insane and destroyed the world, devouring
the sun and the moons and hammering a giant fist into the center of the continent
of Estara.
The world shattered in an event simply known as "the apocalypse" in later times.

However, the world was not completely lost; Zhes offspring, the lesser gods,
sacrificed themselves to save the remnants of the world.
They bled their celestial life onto the world and the life upon it.
Creating a world that, albeit cold, harsh, and much smaller was habitable and
even fecund in some areas. Life was altered to flourish in the new environment.


## Estara

The entire area encircled by the Ring Mountains used to be a single empire called Estara.
The countries in estara were all governed by the High Priests of Zhestaria (The Temple of Zhe),
locatec roughly in the middle of the empire.

Some of the countries in the Estarian empire were there wilingly and prospered. Others were ruled with an iron fist.

## Ring Mountains

The ring mountains are living crystal structures that seem grow continuously.
They are quite steep and range from 5 to 10 km in height.
Above the 2-3 km threshold, the stone/crystal starts to glow, and the glow becomes more intense the higher you go.

This glow is the crystal reacting with the divine essence that surrounds the world, converting their mass to raw magical power.
This process degenerates the crystals, creating an equilibrium such that the mountains remain between 5 and 10km.

It is impossible to tunnel through the mountains because of the hardness and the continual growth of the crystal.
Dwarves have found that tunnelling at least 800 meters below the mountains is possible, but very impractical.

It is said that there are tunnels to the "outside", deep beneath the mountains. Some tunnels lead to the "feywild" - others to a hellish place
Most tunnels lead to an empty wasteland that appears to be empty in all directions -
even though you can see horizon everywhere, some kind of haze makes it impossible to see any objects, persons or buildings further away than 30 meters.

Magic tends to not work correctly in, above and underneath the mountains.
Most types of magic stops working there, while a few simple spells may work, but very erratically.
Magic users risk going mad or dying if trying powerful spells while in the mountains.


## Vast White

The Vast White itself has a more-or-less constant temperature, but it is extremely cold.

The ice in The Vast White is about 20 meters thick. Below that is fresh water.

A number of creatures/monsters live on the ice, in the ice, and in the water beneath it.

Magical Fog covers the ground to a height of about 30-40 centimeters.
The nearer to land you get, the higher the fog.
Unlike normal fog, this fog seems shiny and radiant and can play tricks
on your mind.

Fire spells on The Vast White have their potency diminished because of
the temperature and the fog.


## Arion
Arion was a new, and thus unwilling, addition to the Estarian empire.
Many of its people were taken as slaves to serve in mines in the far south-east or as
labor in the construction of temples to Zhe in the region.

After the apocalypse, Arion has gone back to its former mode of rule and government, which is
an aliance of independent city states.

### Arios
Arios, the "capital" of Arion, is technically not a real city in the sence that it
did not develop organically by settlers; it was created by all the cities in the
Alliance of Arion to house the Ministers and Masters of Arion so that not one
single city could be said to have more power than the others.

For that reason, Arios itself does not have any kind of voting power
and no masters, ministers or elects hail from Arios. The original, pre-apocalypse, city of
Arios was built on the same principles. Also, the new city of Arios has been built to closely
resemble the original and also resised very close to the original site, only moved a bit to
allow Arios to still have a "harbor" of sorts so that sleads and ice ships can dock there.
Being a harbor city, Arios does have a fair amount of trade has has a strong economy.
The taxes in Arios are very low; goods exported out of the city are taxed by around
5 percent and ad-hoc lodgings (i.e. rooms at inns and hotels) are taxed at 10 percent.
Aside from that, the city puts a small tax on the use of the harbor, the rail roads and
the city stables.

## Taransak
Also called the “The city of magic”, this city states resides inside the south western part
of Arion, although it is not a part of the Arion alliance.
The city center houses a large number of magical guild houses, magic shops, luxury inns, hotels
and luxury eateries. Housing in the city center consists of apartments for the extremely rich.
Around the city center, you will find markets of mundane goods houses for the rich and apartments
for the upper middle class.
Outside the city proper you will mostly find houses for the lower and lower middle classes
arranged as small (sometimes walled) vilages.

On the periphery of these villages you will find farm houses and a few guard houses and guard towers.

Crime in Taransak is low. Taxes are relatively high. Anything purchased in the city center is taxed
by 20 percent if you are not a resident of the city. Property owners pay property taxes, collected
on a monthly basis. If a property owner falls more than 3 months behind on their property taxes,
the ownership of the property defaults to the city. Any banks or money lenders may petition the city
to recoup some of their losses.

### Relationship with Arion

Taransak has a special relationship with the other city states of Arion; While not part of the alliance,
its magic users have often taken part in the defense of Arion against Tyathia and the Wraith.

Magic users from all over Arion, and even from the rest of Estara come to study in the guilds of
Taransak, which makes Taransak a free city where a lot of diplomatic back channel communication
is conducted between the city states of Arion and the nations outside the alliance.

Formal diplomatic negotiations between Arion and its neighbours is still usually conducted in Arios.

## Tyathia
Neighboar to the east of Arion.
A former prosperous member of Estara, they keep the traditions alive. They have a cast system.
The lowest cast are called untouchables. These essentialy serve as slaves.
If you are a prisoner of war or a criminal in Tyathia, the local government will sell you as
a slave on a slave market.
Tyathia also have fighting rings á la old rome.

It was originally the armies of Tyathia that invaded Arion and laid claim to its land
and its people on behalf of the Estaran Empire.


## The Plains
Southern neighbour Arion.
This was possibly the most unruly and diversely populated region of Estara.
The population of the plains was heavily culled for slave labour in the pre-apocaypse days.
The Plains are now populated by tribal communities á la "village states".
The tribal leaders have close communications with each other and all strive for unity
to be able to combat any invasion by the Wraith or even by Tyathia.
The Tribes of The Plains have adopted a code very similar to The Code of Arion to be able
to The tribes of The Plains are closely allied with Arion because they see Arion as a
buffer between them and Tyathia.
Even so, Tyathia has previously launched a naval army to try and capture certain
areas of The Plains - however, a united front of warriors from the tribes
repelled the invasion with the aid of weaponry and battle equipment purchased and
loaned from Arion.
