# Notes

## Races
### Demons
When the gods died, most of some of their realms still survived. For instance, all the elemental universes survived, as did some of the realms of the dead.
Many of the "hells" collapsed, releasing a lot of demons into the world. These demons now live in the Ring Mountains. It is said that the demons interbred
with various humanoid species, creating demon half-breeds.

### Angels
As the celestial planes collapsed as well as the hells, some angels were cast down to Arion. It is said that they lived as "normal" humanoids. It is said that celestial blood still run
in some families.

## Geography
In the mountains, it is said that there are tunnels to the "outside". Some tunnels lead to the "feywild" - others to a hellish place
Most tunnels lead to an empty wasteland that appears to be empty in all directions - even though you can see horizon everywhere, some kind of haze makes it impossible
to see any objects, persons or buildings further away than 30 meters.

### Other Worlds
Flying over the mouintains lead to a "cloud world" where a number of populated "asteroids" float around like islands in a sea of glowing mist.
The asteroid-worlds are flat on top and cone shaped underneath.
Often populated, each asteroid is tiny world with their own culture and sometimes unique races.
In the cloud-world, air balloon travel is quite common, as the winds are mild and it enables relatively safe travel from island to island.
Arion is itself such a world - it is the biggest of them all - and it is the only one with ring mountains and an permanent aura of raw magical power.

One can only fly over the rim mountains by non-magical means - riding dragons, flying hot air balloons or using zeppelins.
Hot air ballons can be powered by elementals - however - they must not be summoned - they must be portalled into arion and be here willingly.
