# Campaign

This is the »Arion« campaign.

The first point I'd like to make is that this is *your* campaign.

I'll provide ideas, thoughts and some level of detail, but it's your task to
make Arion come alive. This piece of art is *free* after all.

The world is not, as you might expect, a planet, but rather the remnants of
one. It is a flat and circular area, roughly 2000km in diameter, encircled by
impossibly tall magical radiant mountains that also function as the worlds only
source of heat and light.

What is beyond the mountains is unknown, but I wouldn't be surprised if other
planetary shards might exist out there in the void.  Certainly, people have
tried to climb or even fly over the mountains, but none of these travelers have
ever returned.

I suggest you start the campaign in the "country" of Arion.  Arion is not
actually a country, but rather an alliance of city states, counties and
principalities that have all signed a pledge to uphold the Code of Arion, an
alliance so old that it was ancient even before the cataclysm that destroyed
the sun and the world beyond the mountains.
