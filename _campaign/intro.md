### Angels
As the celestial planes collapsed as well as the hells, some angels were cast down to Arion. It is said that they lived as "normal" humanoids.
It is said that celestial blood still run in some families.
It is also said that mortals cannot handle the blood of angels, and that these mortals invariably go insane in some way.
