The closer you get to The Vast White, the colder it gets.  See *[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4yiu3A-L60)*.

## Airships
Arion has a number of airships.
They are very magical in nature.
Almost all materials involved (ropes, canvas, wood, bone) have been reinforced and improved with magic.

* Hot air dirrigible: using a fire elemental to heat the balloon, and an air elemental to help stear.
* Barge: large "platform" (usually rectangular, but can be elliptical, triangular, etc.) that is
enchanted with elemental air to give it lifting and steering capability.
Some barges have multiple levels to allow for more storage., possibly of increasing or descending sizes to allow for
* Diamond: tetrahedron or octahedron shape. Powered by elemental air.

## Ice Ships
Sleds and even "ships" (with skates) can be built to survive long voyages on The Vast White.
These ships and sleds are usually strengthened with powerful magic to keep
wood, metal and bone from becoming brittle in the cold and fog.

It is extremely important to keep icing on the vehicles to a minimum.

They can be propelled by the wind, but since the wind always goes clockwise
around the center of The Vast White, these ships have a limited number of possible routes,
unless they want to travel all the way around the Vast.

Ships and Sleds can also be propelled by Athryss Whales or other creatures.
Some Ships and Sleds are propelled by magic.
