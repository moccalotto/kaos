## Cold Gear
The closer you get to The Vast White, the colder it gets.  See *[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4yiu3A-L60)*.

 - Waterproof boots and clothes made from seal skin that has been saturated with seal oil.  Fur clothing. Many layers of cloth.

    - Silk Armor enforced with wood and/or bone.
    - Leather armor, enforced with oil, silk, wood and bone.
    - Helmets of cloth, silk and hide, incorporation ice-goggles.

## Airships
Arion has a number of airships.
They are very magical in nature. Almost all materials involved (ropes, canvas, wood, bone) have been reinforced and improved with magic.


## Ice Ships
Sleds and even "ships" (with skates) can be built to survive long voyages on The Vast White.
These ships and sleds are usually strengthened with powerful magic to keep
wood, metal and bone from becoming brittle in the cold and fog.

It is extremely important to keep icing on the vehicles to a minimum.

They can be propelled by the wind, but since the wind always goes clockwise
around the center of The Vast White, these ships have a limited number of possible routes,
unless they want to travel all the way around the Vast.

Ships and Sleds can also be propelled by Athryss Whales or other creatures.
Some Ships and Sleds are propelled by magic.
