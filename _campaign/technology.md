## Cold Gear
The closer you get to The Vast White, the colder it gets.  See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4yiu3A-L60).

 - Waterproof boots and clothes made from seal skin that has been saturated with seal oil.  Fur clothing. Many layers of cloth.
 - Ice googles made from ivory with tiny slits - prevent wind bite and snow blindness.
 - Dog sleds.
 - Ice Ships and sleds 
 - Armors that keep you warm (using metal armor and weapons sucks on the ice)
    - Hide Armor enforced with silk, wood and/or bone.
    - Silk Armor enforced with wood and/or bone.
    - Leather armor, enforced with oil, silk, wood and bone.

## Airships
Arion has a number of airships.
They are very magical in nature. Almost all materials involved (ropes, canvas, wood, bone) have been reinforced and improved with magic.

## Ice Ships
Sleds and even "ships" (with skates) can be built to survive long voyages on The Vast White. 
These ships and sleds are usually strengthened with powerful magic.
They can be propelled by the wind, but since the wind always goes clockwise 
around the center of The Vast White, these ships have a limited number of possible routes,
unless they want to travel all the way around the Vast.

Ships and Sleds can also be propelled by Athryss Whales or other creatures. 
Some Ships and Sleds are propelled by magic.
